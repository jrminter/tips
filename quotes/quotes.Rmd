> You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy
> out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another
> person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to
> anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody
> else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to
> work because the other half is going to take care of them. and when
> the other half of the people gets the idea that it does no good to
> work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that
> my dear friend, is the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth
> by dividing it     
- Dr. Adrian Rogers, 1931.
