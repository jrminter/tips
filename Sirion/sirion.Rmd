# Alignment of the FEI Sirion

## Align the final lens aperture

Before you align the column, be sure that the final lens aperture is correctly
aligned. If the final lens aperture has to be aligned, choose the smallest for
the best results. It is recommended to use **20 kV** and **spot 3**,
**UHR Mode**, with the specimen at a working distance of **5 mm**, the eucentric
working distance in the S-FEG. 

(**JM Note:** check if ours lets us use 20 kV in UHR mode.)

When the aperture is well aligned, the image does not rotate at low
magnification or move at high magnification during focusing.
**The position ofthe final aperture should remain constant and should not be**
**changed further during the alignment procedures.**

We do not use an aperture strip but rather Pt apertures in a CM holder. We
currently have the large hole, a 100 and two 30 micron aperures installed.

1. Go to the UHR Mode at 5 mm WD. Select Zero Beam Shift from the Stage menu.

2. Make an image at a magnification of about 10,000X. Select TV Rate from the
Scan pulldown menu and Average 4 from the Filter pulldown menu.

3. Move the stage to find a good area of interest, and focus as best one can.

4. Center a feature with the **Get** function.

5. Click in the Final Lens Modulator check box in the Beam control area, a
cross appears in the center of the screen and the image rotates about a point
on the screen.

6. Adjust the position of the aperture so that the center of the rotation is
over the cross.

7. Increase the magnification to 20,000X and realign. If necessary, repeat at
40,000X. At higher magnification the image moves very slightly in a certain
direction. By tuning the aperture, you can minimize this movement.

8. When corrected, switch off the Final Lens Modulator. There should be no image
shift when the focus control is used.

### Gun Tilt and Shift Field Adjustments

To perform a complete column alignment, use the adjustment procedures starting
with 20kV at Step 1 in the UHR Mode and work down to 500V, saving the results
at each procedure. Each individual adjustment is a complete step-by-step
procedure. For 30kV the mode can be changed to the HR Mode, the sequence in the
procedure being the same.

Use the rectangular X-Y control with cross-hair to change the setting of the
corresponding parameter. Click the left mouse button in this area. You can step
back and forth through each procedure (using the + or - buttons) and go to
another control area for further optimization of the image.

When each procedure ends, the adjustments are stored in the computer. When the
column is correctly aligned, the image stays in focus, and it does not show
substantial image displacement when you change kV and spot-size.
Later when you select a kV that is not in the list, the software performs
an interpolation between the values stored in the table.

### Gun Tilt and Shift Functions

The Gun Tilt and Shift adjustment control area shows the following Information
and functions. The White items in the table are significant to the alignment and
the Gray items are for additional information to the user.


| Field Name | Function |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GTX,Y | Displays actual value of Gun Tilt X and Gun Tilt Y stored during last alignment. |
| GSX,Y | Displays actual value of Gun Shift X and Gun Shift Y stored during last alignment. |
| High Tension | Displays actual value of the kV. |
| ProbeCurr | Displays spot-size. The procedure starts with spot-size 1 and steps up to spot-size 7. |
| X-Over | Switches to crossover mode. Shows a marker on screen and positions the crossover relative to it. Use crossover mode only when there is no image. Use Gun Tilt and Gun Shift controls to bring the crossover to the center of the on-screen marker.|
| Lens Mod | Switches on the final lens modulator that modulates the final lens at the given magnification with amplitude coupled to magnification. Switch the scan mode to TV rate before using this mode. If the system is correctly aligned, the rotation center is in the center of the screen. |
| Intermediate Lens Mode |Service use only |
| DC On | Service use only. Default ON |
| Contrast |  Controls contrast of the applied detector. Use it if the contrast changes when spot-size is changed during the alignment steps. |
| Gun Tilt / Shift | Controls Gun Tilt and Gun Shift adjustments in both X and Y. The actual Gun Tilt and Gun Shift setting is indicated by the position of the cross in the field. If more tilt/shift is required at the edge of the screen, release the mouse button and click again in the control. |
| 0 Tilt, Shift | These buttons set Gun Tilt and Gun Shift to zero. |
