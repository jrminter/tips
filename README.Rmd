   > something a man must fear.    
   >
   > Tom Clancy, The Hunt for Red October, page 28


6. A helpful quote from Adam Grant

   > Anger is often seen as an irrational emotion. But it’s not due
   > to the absence of logic — it’s due to the presence of threat or harm.

   > 
   > Understanding what makes you angry is a prism for understanding
   > what you value.

29. Today I learned (TIL)

    2020-05-25:    
   
    It appears that now I need to run RStudio as an administrator on
    Windows 10 to install packages.
      
    Two ways to do it:
      
    - Right click on a **Desktop** RStudio icon and choose `Run as Administrator`
    - Right click on the tool-bar RStudio Icon, **pull up**, and choose `Run as Administrator`.
   
    -  ![How to run RStudio as admin from toolbar](./R/inc/R-as-admin-toolbar.png).
    
    This **really annoying** since my profile is an administrator...

    2020-05-14:    
        **Do not update your iPhone OS right before a run**. The update
        **appeared** to be done, but my music was skipping for about
        20 min. Guess there was processing in the background.
   
    2020-05-18:   
    
        **Update Microsoft Office**    
        - Open an Office application, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. ...    
        - Click on `Account` or `Office Account` on the list.    
        - Under Product Information, click on `Update Options` next to `Office Updates`.    
        - From the list of options, click on `Update Now`.

30. Chrome Bookmarks - How to move a folder...

    From [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/3479132?hl=en).
   
    > **Under Bookmarks**, open Bookmark Manager. If you want to move FOLDERS
    > that are within another folder (parent folder) you need to select the
    > parent folder in the left window. Then you click on the NAME of the
    > folder you want to move in the right side window. DO NOT click on the
    > little 'folder' icon-- it will not work.


31. Keyboard shortcut for the `dplyr` pipe operator

      ```
      Win: `%>%` - Ctl + Shift + M    
      Mac: `%>%` - CMD + Shift + M   
      ```

32. Fix a `recurring github credential problem` - run:
   
      ```
      Sys.unsetenv("GITHUB_PAT")
      Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")
      ```

33. The R `janitor` package is your friend. It cleans up
     non-standard column names .

34. CDC Corona Virus Recommendations

      > The CDC recommends washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after
      > using the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose or sneezing. It
      > also advises not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth and to clean objects and
      > surfaces you touch often.
      >
      > “These are all things you can do to prevent the spread of pretty much any
      > respiratory virus,” Brewer said.

35. Closed captions in CBS All access

      > Go to www.cbs.com. Find a full episode of a series that you're
      > interested in and click on it. To turn the captions on, bring your
      > cursor into the middle of the video to see the menu show up. Look 
      > for and click on the plus sign for "More" on the lower right hand
      > side, click again on "CC captions" just once.


36. The Feynman technique of learning:

      - Step 1: Pick and study a topic

      - Step 2: Explain the topic to someone, like a child, who is unfamiliar
        with the topic

      - Step 3: Identify any gaps in your understanding 

      - Step 4: Review and Simplify!
    
      More [here](./Feynman_technique/Feynman_technique.html)...
    
37. Install command line tools on MacOS

      `xcode-select --install`

38. Regex for youtube time stamps. Useful in SublimeText3!

      `\d\d:\d\d`

39. Symbolic links. I always get this backwards...

      ```
      file     link
      ln -s source destination
      ```

40. Fun snippets

41. Getting started with data science

      - A very helpful article from
          [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/setup-data-science-environment).

42. Clear the Chrome Cache

      - Press "CTRL" + "Shift" + "Delete" keys in Windows or Linux
      - Press "Command" + "Shift" + "Delete"" keys on MacOS.

43. Delete Specific Cookies in Chrome for Mac OS X

      From [osxdaily.com](http://osxdaily.com/2016/07/02/delete-cookies-chrome-browser/)
      You can remove a specific website cookie from Chrome by doing the following
      This skips several steps from original article!    
      - Open `chrome://settings/siteData` as a URL

      - Scroll to look at the list or use the `Search` box if you want to
      quickly find a specific site URL.

      - To remove the cookie(s), then select the site and click the
      **trash can icon** to delete cookies for the site.

      - Rinse and repeat for other sites...

      - Avoid cookie placement and cache generation in the first place by using
      the Chrome `Incognito Mode` private browsing feature.
  
44. Automatically download all files in a directory

      Let's also exclude all the `index.html` files... 
      
      ```
      wget -r --no-parent --reject "index.html*" http://my/url
      ```
        
45. How to block someone on Facebook

      block and click `Block`.
      - Select the specific person you want to block ans click
      `Block > Block [name]`
      ```
      ```


46. Convert `.mkv` to `.mp4` from the command line

      ```
      ffmpeg -i vid.mkv -c copy vid.mp4
      ```
      
      for conversion of vid.mov to vid.mp4
      
      ```
      ffmpeg -i vid.mov -vcodec h264 -acodec mp2 vid.mp4
      ```
      
      Note: this converts frame-by-frame and can be slow.
      I downloaded ffmpeg on macos via homebrew.

47. HTML Syntax

  - A link
    
      ```
      <a href="https://...">Label</a>
      ```
    
  - A paragraph
    
      ```
      <p>A paragraph</p>

  - A quote
    
    ```
    <q>A quote</q>
    ```

    <p>A second long paragraph of text.</p>
