# High Resolution Imaging

## From Antonio Carlos Joaquim

2021-09-10

> Hi Stephane, In addition to the Gold standard used to measure the
resolution I used real samples such as metallic PVD nanolayers.
Three factors needed to be improved to get 1,000,000X image:
Faraday cage coil system to minimize magnetic interference;
Anti-vibration shoe system to minimize floor chattering effect;
Plasma Cleaning System to eliminate carbohydrate contamination.

> Hi Stephane,

> Along with all the excellent input and advice already posted, I'd also recommend cleaning your Au on C standard too. The surface will inevitably become contaminated over time, adding to surface contamination and resolution problems during high res imaging. Plasma or ozone cleaning both work well, plus try storing the standard in a clean cabinet, even under vacuum.

# Good advice from Henry Baker

One of the first documents Ned Thomas gave me was an excerpt from Henry Baker's book "[The Microscope Made Easy](https://books.google.com/books?id=__QLAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Cautions+in+viewing+Objects%22)" (1743). The quote below comes from pages 62 and 63. I changed the case of some words for modern English usage.

> Beware of determining and declaring your opinion suddenly on any object; for imagination often gets the start of judgment and makes people believe they see things which better observations will convince them could not possibly be seen: therefore assert nothing til after repeated experiments and examinations in all lights and all positions.
>
> When you employ the microscope, shake off all prejudice, nor harbor any favorite opinions; for, if you do, 'tis not unlikely fancy will betray you into error, and make you see what you wish to see.
>
> Remember, that truth alone is the matter you are in search after; and if you have been mistaken, let not vanity seduce you to persist in your mistake.
> 
> Pass no judgment upon things over-extended by force or contracted by dryness or in any manner out of their natural state without making suitable allowances.

# Storage of air-sensitive samples

## [Hendrik O. Colijn](mailto:colijn.1@osu.edu) 2016-12-03

I repurposed an old glass desiccator that had a pump-out port in the lid as a low-O2 storage unit. Basically, I stuck a styrofoam coffee cup inside and filled it with LN2 and left the pumping port open to vent the boil-off. I figure that the N2 is generally going to be colder than the residual atmosphere and force the warmer air out the port. When the LN2 has evaporated, I just close the valve.

We had some people put SEM mounts that were in the air-tight storage tubes in the desiccator. I'm not sure how much good that did!

# LaB6 Cathodes

A thread from the microscopy listserver 2016-04-20

## [John L. Grazul](jlg98@cornell.edu)

Fellow microscopists it has been a long time since I have posted mainly because anything that comes out of Cornell is un-postable for really good reasons I assume. The huge issue I have been having for the past couple of years is the quality, reliability and life span of my LaB6 sources. Now this is not an issue with just one scope or just one vendor. Tungsten filaments work fantastic and hit all the numbers perfectly in both of our 120kV Tecnais.  When we put a LaB6 in really weird things happen. Before you get suspicious and think we just started up with LaB6, this is all that we have ever used on our tools, I just had to test the scopes with W to make sure I wasn't imagining things. We need LaB6 because of the brightness and hours of use; each scope is used 40-50 hr/week. So much for the introduction, now on to the issues:

1. I have not seen a Maltese cross on either a Kimball or Denka in 5 years or so, or about 5- 8 filaments, on either of my Tecnais. The engineers and I just undersaturate and go for max brightness.

2. Filament life used to be 2500-3000 hours, the last five tips have flamed out around 500 hours. BTW the vacuum has been rock steady in both scopes.

3. I have had two tips fail due to micro cracks in the carbon crucible.

4. The last five tips drift for the first 100-200 hours, and we are talking X-Y and Z. This is to the point that the deflectors can't compensate and I have to break vacuum and re-center manually.

5. My 24 Volt power supply for the filament is fine, swapped them around my scopes with the same result.

If the darn things didn't cost nearly $900.00 I might tolerate this. I have to give high marks to EMS, they have been listening to my complaints and have made good on the tips that have failed out of the box. But the quality of the product I really have questions about. Has Kimball changed their carbon supplier, is it softer? Why are there cracks?

And the last question is have any of you guys had the same or similar issues? And the absolutely final question is am I missing something? After 30+ years of ripping scopes apart I might just have lost the magic touch or there is a vortex of Lab6 instability issues in Ithaca.

## [Robert Keyse](rok210@lehigh.edu)

We've had similar issues with the LaB6 filament image (odd shape) and used the gun tilt to max out the screen current as an alignment technique.  We also have the filament image moving across the screen when saturation is being approached.  But the latter is what I've been told is due to some dirt on the final anode or some nearby electrode perhaps in the accelerator.  This wandering is happening with W filaments too and is less critical at lower mags.

I went to put a new LaB6 filament in the other day and it just broke off, much to my embarrassment and I'm putting off buying a new one for a while.  FYI our microscope is a JEOL 2000FX and vacuum isn't a problem so long as we replace the ion pump every five years.  The new one that broke while I was putting it in was a KP (the Denka are welded and robust).

The thing that has my blood boiling is the so-called long-life FEI gallium sources that don't last more than three months.  And as you may know they come in at over $2000 each, as do the expendable extractors similarly priced.  The one we got with the new install lasted very nicely, but since then not so much.

Best of luck with your search here,

## [Hendrik O. Colijn](colijn.1@osu.edu)

I've had some issues over the past several years with the Kimball Physics LaB6 cathodes.  (I'm not sure which brand you are using.)  After meticulously setting the depth and centering the cathode, I run out of gun tilt when warming it up.  After pulling it back out of the scope, I find that the cathode is still perfectly centered in the wehnelt.  I often go through 3 or 4 iterations before I can get a usable setting of the cathode, each time finding that it looks perfectly centered outside of the scope.

My suspicion is that the legs have slightly different resistances and that one leg warms up more than the other pushing the cathode to the side.  When the cathode cools back down, the tip recenters itself.  This theory is pretty hard to verify since I can't directly observe the tip while it is warm.  If I can get the tip centered enough I do see the "maltese cross" figure though sometimes it's a bit off center.

One thing that may affect your lifetime is the filament limit for saturation.  I have noticed that if I initially set the cathode to be just saturated, then check it 20-30 minutes later I find I can back the filament drive off by 1 or 2 clicks and it is still saturated.  I assume that as the components warm up, the saturation point changes slightly. I do have to tell the students that this is the correct way to operate so that they don't reset the limit themselves.  So, I now set my filament limit to be at least one click undersaturated.  This way, as it warms up, it will bring itself to the proper saturation point.  Note that the Kimball Physics documents indicate that the evaporation rate will triple in going from 1800K to 1850K.  This will bring the lifetime from ~2000 hours down to a 600-700 hour range.

If the tip isn't oxidized by one of the students, I can still get close to 2000 hours from a cathode. I did have one student destroy one in 20 minutes by letting the cold trap warm up while it was hot. (I was NOT happy.)

Kimball Physics has some useful info in the technical documents on their web site.

# Chillers

From Bill Tivol 2015-05-26 on the Microscopy Listserver

> When I was in charge of the HVEM, we left the chillers on all the
time, and in over 20 years we had no problems.  We added an
anti-corrosion preparation from Aqua Labs, Aquatreet 42, which was
Mo-based, and we kept the pH between 7.5 and 8 to prevent solvation of
the Cu tubing.  If Aqua Labs cannot supply the product, Skasol has a
similar one.  (Aqua supplied the East, and Skasol, at least, the West).
