# Software Carpentry Introduction

The
[Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
SQL material and the videos: Parts 
[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7s1qEfpn4),
[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ADpklXo9c),
[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u66tF5q3LA), and
[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN95fa_UrY)
are quite helpful, even though they are a bit dated (2012). Greg Wilson
illustrates database use using **SQLite**. Here I summarize the main
points.

## [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7s1qEfpn4)

Greg's objective is to explain why these systems are structured the way
they are in order to use them effectively. He illustrates the concept
using this test database. He suggests we refer frequently to this figure.

![Database design](./inc/png/database_tables.png)

Greg notes that he is conflating two concepts. A **database** is a pile
of data. A **database manager** is is a program that manipulates data
stored in that particular way. There are five such programs that were
extant in 2012:

1. Oracle
2. IBM DB2

These are expensive, powerful, complicated systems with tens of
thousands of hours invested in development.

There are two Opens Source systems in common usage.

3. MySQL. Its status is a bit problematic these days so we are seeing
people shift to another one that has been cleaner and better engineered.

4. PostgreSQL. In 2012, Greg suggested that these days this should be
our choice.

All four of these are complicated to configure. The fifth choice is
simpler.

5. SQLite. SQL is the language. This is the smallest complete
implementation of SQL. It is not really fast but it is small.
Modern smart phones use it to store music play lists and contacts.
It can still handle hundreds or thousands of operations per second
and you can move databases from one machine to another by moving a
single file rather than a complicated export process.    
    
**Note** To call sqlite on MacOS:

1. install sqlite (brew install sqlite)     

2. start with `sqlite3`.    
   Type your commands...    
   Type `ctl z` to quit sqlite.
   Type `ps` to get a list of processes. Note the PID for sqlite.
   Type `kill the_pid`   
   You should get a terminal prompt.
   

All five systems use a **relational model**. Technically they are
**Relational Database Management Systems** (RDBMS). All of these
systems store informations as a set of **rectangular tables**. The
database is the collection of all the tables. Each table has a
**fixed number of columns** but a **variable number of rows**.

The columns are the **fields** in the records. There are ways
tables can add columns but in general they are fixed at design time.
The **records** contain the information. We can **add** and **delete**
records any time we want. That is easy. Each record has the same shape
as all the others in the table and each record is uniquely identified 
by a name. 

If I want to identify the records in the `Person` table by the 
`LastName`, all the records in that table would have the `Person`
entry of the same type (e.g. strings). In such a system each
column will have a type designated at design time.

All these systems have a solid theoretical design. This is one of the
instances where computer science design and practice actually
inform each other. There is a rich set of mathematics behind this that
defines the relationships one can express. This model dominates
commercial data processing.

Today (2012) there has be a rise in alternatives to RDBMS systems.
There are many different kinds of alternatives. They go under the name
**NoSQL** (non SQL databases). Some are running places like Google
because Google didn't think RDBMS scaled to that scale of transactions.
Others are meant to handle unstructured documents. Others are designed
to handle graphs and nodes, like friends on Facebook.

We still don't know which of these will succeed or fail. Greg expects
that later they will add one of the alternatives, but for now the 
prudent choice is to wait and see which choices survive and are
useful to a significant population of scientists.

We will start with SQLite. The instructors supplied the database as a
file `experiments.db`. We open the database from the command prompt.
Note that we get a shell prompt.

```
$ sqlite3 experiments.db
SQLite version 3.13.0 2016-05-18 10:57:30
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
```

Let's start with a query: `select` is a keyword. We want to grab some
data. We then specify **which fields** we want and **which table**
they are coming from:

```
sqlite> select Login, FirstName, LastName from Person;
skol|Sofia|Kovalevskaya
mlom|Mikhail|Lomonosov
dmitri|Dmitri|Mendeleev
ivan|Ivan|Pavlov
```

The query returns all the records we ask for. We could select in a
different order and the query would return the values in the order
we specify:

```
sqlite> select LastName, FirstName, Login from Person;
Kovalevskaya|Sofia|skol
Lomonosov|Mikhail|mlom
Mendeleev|Dmitri|dmitri
Pavlov|Ivan|ivan
sqlite> 
```

To get **everything**, use `select *` to return **all of the records**.

```
sqlite> select * from Person;
skol|Kovalevskaya|Sofia
mlom|Lomonosov|Mikhail
dmitri|Mendeleev|Dmitri
ivan|Pavlov|Ivan
```

We can do more. We specify the **table** and the **condition** which 
is called the **filter**. We only keep the records that pass the
test.

```
sqlite> select * from Person where Login='skol';
skol|Kovalevskaya|Sofia
```

The **order** is important. Consider the following which still works:

```
sqlite> select * from Person where Login='skol';
skol|Kovalevskaya|Sofia
```

as does the query below, because we have all the rows and columns
available to extract information. We filter on rows using the `where`
keyword. This provides a way to zero in on particular records of
interest.

```
sqlite> select LastName from Person where Login='skol';
Kovalevskaya
```

Let's try a more complex query. Here it gets all the rows and columns
from the Person table and keeps the ones where the Login is 'skol'
or 'mlom' and outputs their LastNames.

```
sqlite> select LastName from Person where Login in ('skol', 'mlom');
Kovalevskaya
Lomonosov
```

what happens if I reverse the order of the Login? RDBMS systems work
with sets. Sets aren't ordered. We always have to print the results.
The database stores the information in a way to output the data the
fastest. If you want to force a particular order, you have to do that.

```
sqlite> select LastName from Person where Login in ('mlom', 'skol');
Kovalevskaya
Lomonosov
```

Let's force an order... This is getting to be a long query. We
can split lines. Note how sqlite3 continues the line until the
query ends with a semicolon.

```
ssqlite> select LastName from Person
   ...> where Login in ('mlom', 'skol')
   ...> order by LastName;
Kovalevskaya
Lomonosov
```

Note how we can specify **descending** order with the `DESC` filter
(`ASC` will give **ascending** order). The query must specified any
required output order.

```
sqlite> select LastName from Person
   ...> where Login in ('mlom', 'skol')
   ...> order by LastName DESC;
Lomonosov
Kovalevskaya
```


If you forget the semicolon, the program will wait until you supply one
to continue.

## [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ADpklXo9c)

SQL is one of the few languages that is case insensitive. Fortran is
another. We need to use case to make the code **readable**. The **data**
is case sensitive but the commands **are not**.

We could write:

```
sqlite> SELECT lastName frOM perSON
   ...> where LoGiN in ('skol', 'mlom');
Kovalevskaya
Lomonosov
```
The column names and queries can be written in any arbitrary case.
**DO NOT DO THIS** Write the code to make it **readable**.

A consistent style is more readable. Pick one and be **consistent**.
```
sqlite> SELECT lastname FROM person
   ...> WHERE login IN ('skol', 'mlom');
Kovalevskaya
Lomonosov
```

We now have a way to select particular rows. Let's look at the 
**Experiment** table. We would like to extract all the experiments
with a positive number of hours. Two have negative numbers of
hours. These are the time travel experiment. It must be going well :).
But we want to exclude the data because we only want to bill positive
hours to the funding agency.

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment;
1214|1|1||1.5
1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
```

which we change to

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment
   ...> WHERE hours >=0;
1214|1|1||1.5
1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
```

### Dealing with missing data
Compare 

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment
   ...> where ExperimentDate >= '1900-00-00';
1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
```

and

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment
   ...> where ExperimentDate < '1900-00-00';
1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
```

Note that we only have a total of **5** experiments. The problem is
the **NULL** value in the first entry of the table. This is both useful
and infuriating when dealing with database systems. Note:

```
sqlite> SELECT NULL >= 0;

sqlite> SELECT NULL < 0;

sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment WHERE experimentdate IS NOT NULL;
1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
sqlite> SELECT * FROM experiment WHERE experimentdate IS NULL;
1214|1|1||1.5
```

This is **not** a problem with the database. it **is** a problem
with **missing data** For example, one might have a record of the month
and day and be uncertain of the year because of the way the date was
recorded. Some people may not have submitted and address. Or an 
address may not include a postal code. These are not problems caused
by the database. For example, homeless people do not have an address.
Excluding them may easily skew the results. This is **no different**
than having a piece of analytical equipment with a systematic
bias. View this as a scientific problem to model and account for.

For now wr want to get data from both the project and experiment
tables. The **JOIN** operator creates the cross product between
the tables. We get 3*6 or 18 rows in the resulting table.

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM project JOIN experiment;
1214|Antigravity|1214|1|1||1.5
1214|Antigravity|1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1214|Antigravity|1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1214|Antigravity|1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1214|Antigravity|1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1214|Antigravity|1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
1709|Teleportation|1214|1|1||1.5
1709|Teleportation|1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|Teleportation|1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|Teleportation|1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1709|Teleportation|1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1709|Teleportation|1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
1737|Time Travel|1214|1|1||1.5
1737|Time Travel|1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1737|Time Travel|1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1737|Time Travel|1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1737|Time Travel|1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1737|Time Travel|1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
```

So now I change the query to:

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM project JOIN experiment
   ...> WHERE Project.ProjectId = Experiment.ProjectID;
1214|Antigravity|1214|1|1||1.5
1214|Antigravity|1214|2|1|1889-11-01|14.3
1709|Teleportation|1709|1|3|1891-01-22|7.0
1709|Teleportation|1709|2|1|1891-02-23|7.2
1737|Time Travel|1737|1|1|1900-07-05|-1.0
1737|Time Travel|1737|2|2|1900-07-05|-1.5
```

Now we modify the query to:

1. JOIN the Project and Experiment tables
2. Filter cases WHERE Project.ProjectId = Experiment.ProjectID
3. SELECT (and print) Project.ProjectName and Experiment.Hours

```
sqlite> SELECT Project.ProjectName, Experiment.Hours
   ...> FROM Project JOIN Experiment
   ...> WHERE Project.ProjectId = Experiment.ProjectID;
Antigravity|1.5
Antigravity|14.3
Teleportation|7.0
Teleportation|7.2
Time Travel|-1.5
Time Travel|-1.0
```

Note that ID numbers are often keys for these types of sorts.
We want these types of identifiers to be immutable (unchanging).
We may want to revise  project ID but **not** the underlying 
key. A name might change (i.e. marriage) but we want a constant
personal identifier that doesn't.

The SQL we have seen thus far represents at least half the queries
we will write. We can join queries from different tables, filter out
the stuff we don't want and then keep only the next stage in the process.


## [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u66tF5q3LA)

Let's try to make our query a little more efficient.

We now go to a text file. Greg is using `svn` so the `$ID$` line
is helpful. Not so much with github...

Here is the first version of the **project-hours.sql** file.
Note the comment lines starting with `--` and the use of the
re-direct to the shell (`< project-hours.sql`)

```
-- Display project names and hours for each experiment
-- sqlite3 experiments.db < project-hours.sql
-- The following line would be helpful with svn...
-- SELECT "$Id:$";
SELECT Project.ProjectName, Experiment.Hours
FROM Project JOIN Experiment
WHERE Project.ProjectId = Experiment.ProjectID;
```

This produces the output:

```
Antigravity|1.5
Antigravity|14.3
Teleportation|7.0
Teleportation|7.2
Time Travel|-1.5
Time Travel|-1.0
```

There are many more things on can do with **JOIN**. These are covered in
their [on-line](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
materials.

The most important thing is to keep the process model in mind. The data
are stored in rectangular tables. The tables have fixed columns with
variable rows. One select fields of interest by joining tables and
to get all possible combinations of data. Then you use filters such as
WHERE to throw away things you don't want and you do the select to keep 
just the columns you want.

## Database Administration

There are many commands in SQLite3 and other similar programs for
DB admin. Each system is a bit different. In SQLite3 `.help` gives
and extensive list:

```
jrmFastMac:sql jrminter$ sqlite3 experiments.db
SQLite version 3.13.0 2016-05-18 10:57:30
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .help
.auth ON|OFF           Show authorizer callbacks
.backup ?DB? FILE      Backup DB (default "main") to FILE
...
```

One of the choices is to ask for the **SCHEMA**:

```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE Person(
    Login        TEXT,
    LastName    TEXT,
    FirstName    TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE Project(
    ProjectId    INTEGER,
    ProjectName    TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE Experiment(
    ProjectId    INTEGER,
    ExperimentId    INTEGER,
    NumInvolved    INTEGER,
    ExperimentDate    DATE,
    Hours        REAL
);
CREATE TABLE Involved(
    ProjectId    INTEGER,
    ExperimentId    INTEGER,
    InvolvedId    INTEGER,
    Login        TEXT
);
```

The **schema** is the logical information for the database or its
shape. This shows the commands to set up the database. It doesn't
populate the database with any data.

I could create a table

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE Success(
   ...> ProjectId integer,
   ...> Status bool
   ...> );
```

Note we were inconsistent with case

```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE Person(
    Login        TEXT,
    LastName     TEXT,
    FirstName    TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE Project(
    ProjectId    INTEGER,
    ProjectName  TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE Experiment(
    ProjectId      INTEGER,
    ExperimentId   INTEGER,
    NumInvolved    INTEGER,
    ExperimentDate DATE,
    Hours          REAL
);
CREATE TABLE Involved(
    ProjectId    INTEGER,
    ExperimentId INTEGER,
    InvolvedId   INTEGER,
    Login        TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE Success(
    ProjectId integer,
    Status bool
);
```

so we can **carefully** drop the table

```
sqlite> DROP TABLE Success;
```

And re-create and populate

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE Success(
   ...>     ProjectID INTEGER,
   ...>     Status BOOL
   ...> );

sqlite> SELECT * from Project;
1214|Antigravity
1709|Teleportation
1737|Time Travel
sqlite> INSERT INTO Success VALUES(1214, 1);
sqlite> INSERT INTO Success VALUES(1709, 0);
sqlite> INSERT INTO Success VALUES(1737, 1);
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Success;
1214|1
1709|0
1737|1
```

This is bad database design. We have two tables that mirror
each other row-for-row. We really should add a column to Project
with the success. See the
[on-line](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
materials on table design.
Badly designed data comes back to bite you.

## [Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN95fa_UrY)

### Processing pipelines

We can do something like this from the shell:

```
$ sqlite3 experiments.db < project-hours.sql | grep -v '$Id'
Antigravity|1.5
Antigravity|14.3
Teleportation|7.0
Teleportation|7.2
Time Travel|-1.5
Time Travel|-1.0
$ sqlite3 experiments.db < project-hours.sql | grep -v '$Id' | wc
       6       8     103
```

You will almost always use R or python.

Here is a Python example (**all-names.py**). All the different 
libraries try to provide the same set of function calls so that
you can access the data the same way. In theory, only two parts
change in your program as you change DBMS systems.

1. Load the library.
2. Connect to the database. Think of a connection like a 
phone number. Just the name of a file. Others
will be a URL and likely will need a userid and password.
Large sites will have to manage many
(thousands of) different connections, some that take a long time.
3. Get a cursor from the connection. Think of this like an extension 
during a phone call. This is the object that keeps track of the query.
4. Use the cursor to send the query.
5. Use the cursor to fetch requests - either one at a time or in batches
depending upon the number I expect. Think of Amazon. Show books - send 20,
the fetch more as needed. Here we fetch all.
6. Process and print the results. In this case there will be two fields.
7. Close the cursor.
8. Close the connection. Polite thing to do to permit reuse.

The [on-line](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/)
material discusses the things that can go wrong during
this process.

```
from sqlite3 import dbapi2 as sqlite

connection = sqlite.connect("experiments.db")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT FirstName, Lastname FROM Person ORDER BY LastName;")
results = cursor.fetchall();
for r in results:
    print(r[0], r[1])
cursor.close();
connection.close();
```

and the output

```
$ python all-names.py
Sofia Kovalevskaya
Mikhail Lomonosov
Dmitri Mendeleev
Ivan Pavlov
jrmFastMac:sql jrminter$
```

### Why two programming languages?

Why use SQL and R or Python? SQL is not a complete programming
language. It enters and retrieves data. It does this fast and well.
These tasks have been highly tuned, made reliable, and secure. We
can't beat this.

SQL doesn't do everything, so we need other domain specific processing.

We will likely see NonSQL databases become more popular and useful.
SQL will be around for a long time. SQLite is worth learning,
