Old Access databases are a real pain. One idea is to convert them to
sqlite. Below is an example from
[Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/mdb-sqlite/).
Need to try this for wipe tests...

# Description

Provides automated conversion of MS Access 2000 databases to SQLite on
any platform, utilizing Jackcess and SQLite Java libraries. No native
driver required.

MDB-SQLite is used by Plausible Labs to read government-supplied Access
databases.

## Usage

To compile, run:

```
ant dist
```

This will create a standalone jar in dist/mdb-sqlite.jar

To convert a database file:

```
java -jar dist/mdb-sqlite.jar source.mdb output.sqlite
```
