# Introduction

Zoom is a very helpful tool for online meetings


# Always Turn Video Off

Unless video is a necessity, we have found that turning it off can help
increase the clarity of the call.

This particular setting allows you to turn it off when entering a call
(you can always turn it on later) â€” which is another helpful way to
reduce sudden interruptions.

**You can access Video Settings directly from a Zoom call by clicking**
**the arrow next to the camera**.
