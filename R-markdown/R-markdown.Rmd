# Overview

**R-markdown** is a powerful light-weight formatting language that enables the
author to generate attractive documents that are stored in plain text files
that are compatible with version control. This works very well in the
**RStudio** environment.

## Some key tips

1. Control the width of the HTML output

Insert the following below the YAML

```
<style type="text/css">
.main-container {
  max-width: 750px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
```

Another approach would be to save this a `style.css` and add to the
YAML like this:

```
output:
  html_document:
    css: style.css
```

2. Render markdown code in a RMarkdown Document

   From [support.rstudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018181633-Including-verbatim-R-code-chunks-inside-R-Markdown)

   The code below will be rendered

   ![A markdown snippet in a .Rmd document](png/markdown_snippet.png)


    ````markdown
`r ''````{r}
plot(cars)
```
    ````

## Helpful template examples

- A helpful idea from [Sean Kross](https://twitter.com/seankross/status/1176026465403408385):

```
    library(lubridate)
    backtick r stamp("Updated Monday September 23, 2019 at 8:55")(now()) backtick
```

which produces when knit:

        `r stamp("Updated Monday September 23, 2019 at 8:55")(now())`

# Rmarkdown Kung Fu

## A document format for landcape PDF files

1. We need a file, `header.tex`

   The contents:
   
   ```
   \usepackage{lscape}
   \newcommand{\blandscape}{\begin{landscape}}
   \newcommand{\elandscape}{\end{landscape}}
   ```
   
   This file is [here](files/header.tex).
   
2. We need a `.Rmd` file

   An exemplar is [here](files/exemplar.Rmd).


## Quick tips

- Degree symbol w/o Unicode:    
  Unicode can cause issues rendering to PDF via LaTeX...

    ```
    100$^\circ$ C
    ```

    100$^\circ$ C


## List available languages

Rmarkdown/knitr support **many** languages!

From [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html)

```{r listAvailabeLanguages}

names(knitr::knit_engines$get())

```


## Jenny Bryan's hint

[Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1098104289279365120)

Replying to @S_Owla:

![.R, then feel free to knit/render it anyway!](./png/jenny-bryan-knit-r.png)

## Cool Rmarkdown rendering trick

From [Thea Knowles](https://twitter.com/theaknowles/status/1112125615174385664):

```
Just learned that with kableExtra you can do:

df %>% kable("latex") %>% as_image()

which will render the kable output as an image and happily show up across all platforms✨

```

## Selective page break for PDF document

Use a chunk that looks like this to only break for PDF...

```
{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, eval=(knitr::opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex')}
cat('\\pagebreak')
```

## Quickly preview any Rmarkdown document in RStudio's viewer

From [Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1057598724342456321)

```

```


## Using the `out.extra` argument to apply styles to a single chunk.

From [zevross.com](http://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/#bonus-knitr-and-r-markdown-functionality)

The code below uses this argument:

```
out.extra='style="background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: inline-block;"'
```

```{r useOutExtra, out.width="50%", out.extra='style="background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: inline-block;"'}
plot(10:1, pch=21, bg="red")
```

# Use default css and custom css file in html_vignette()

There was an interesting discussion on how to include both the default css file and a custom css file in a `html_vignette` document in the **rmarkdown** [issues](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/732) on `github`. J. J. Allaire offered some great options below.

A few options here:

1. Use `!expr` to execute R code to determine the path of the default CSS, e.g.

<tt>
```
css:
  - !expr system.file("rmarkdown/templates/html_vignette/resources/vignette.css", package = "rmarkdown")
  - styles.css

```
</tt>

Create an inline CSS chunk at the end of your document with your custom styles, e.g.

<tt>

```{css}
p {
color: gray;
}
```
</tt>

Use the include `-> in_header` option to include an HTML file that contains a style element with the styles you want.



# YAML for Rmarkdown

**YAML** is an abbreviation for "Yet Another Markup Language". 
R-markdown uses YAML to encode information for later steps in the document
generation process. Each document begins with a YAML header. 
This is an example of a YAML header for an analysis. Note how the \% 
character is escaped. Also note the $\LaTeX$ expression.


## YAML for an HTML document

```

abstract: |
  The particles were deposited on a Si chip and lightly C coated. The 
  morphology appeared to be a mixture of small needles and small equiaxial
  nanoparticles. Clumps seemed to be particles embedded in a film.
  
  Analysis of EDS spectra revealed an atomic fraction of $\dfrac{Al}{Al+Zn}$
  of 3-4\%.

```

## YAML for notes while speaking

When I speak at Northgate, I use `speak.css` to render an HTML document
witn a nice size font and layout to keep me on track...

```
---
title: "My Title<br>yyyy-mm-dd"
# author: "John Minter"
date: "Started: yyyy-mm-yy, Last updated: yyyy-mm-dd"
abstract: |
  This morning we will examine **passage** where...    
  A second line
  and some HTML
  <span style="color:#b30000">**today**</span>?" 

output:

```

## YAML for HTML and PDF with link highlighting

I developed this YAML block where I want `pdf` and `html` with proper
link highlighting (in blue)

```

```

## YAML for a long PDF document with many files

Ken Butler from the University of Toronto shared on the Twitter `#rstats`
[feed](https://twitter.com/KenButler12/status/1123429151749361664)
that he had successfully compiled a long, multi-file document into a PDF
file. Ken overcame memory limitations by compiling with `lualatex` instead
of `pdflatex`. The source code is in his github
[notes](https://github.com/nxskok/notes/) repository.

Note the YAML he used and the code chunks. **_N.B._**: I moved the r chunk
configuration into the three backtick blocks so the code would not execute
here but we can still see the results. This was originally Beamer slides for
lecture notes. Note also the **header-includes**.  Ken used many download calls
to data sets on his website. I prefer more reproducible approaches, with the
data sets in the repository. I think there is a lot of opportunity to use
entries in the `.gitignore` file to keep intermediate files out of the
repository.

```
---
title: "STAC32: Applications of Statistical Methods"
author: "Lecture notes"
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{multicol}
output: 
  beamer_presentation:
    latex_engine: lualatex
    slide_level: 2
    df_print: kable
    theme: "AnnArbor"
    colortheme: "dove"
---

    ```
    {r setup, include=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 5)
    # knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
    options(width=55)
    ```

# Course outline

# Running R

    ```
    {r child="running_R.Rmd"}
    ```

# Reading in data

    ```
    {r child="readfile_R.Rmd"}
    ```
```

## YAML that generated date/time at rendering

Note that one can generate the date and time at document generation time by
using an R chunk in the YAML header.

by putting the R expression:

    r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')
    
in the blank area below (I had to enter this way or it would compile...)

    date: "`    `"

to create the YAML entry...

## YAML for a complicated PDF document.

PDF documents can have some **really complicated** YAML.
I spent a couple of hours getting this example to work well.
I don't want **future me** to have to repeat the process...

    df_print: tibble
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: '2'
    highlight: 'tango'
abstract: |
  Controlled radical polymerization was used to graft
  poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(methyl
  methacrylate)-co-poly(butyl acrylate) (PMMA-co-PBA) copolymers on the
  surface of aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) nanorods. The polymer bonded AZO
  particles stay suspended in the coating solutions and form strong
  interactions between the particle and the polymer matrix. Deposited
  films of the polymer modified particles show piezoresistive behavior.
  Plots of pressure and electrical resistance changes with time show the
  inverse relationship of resistance and pressure for free standing films.
  Using similar chemistry, polymer grafted zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods were
  added to dimethylformamide (DMF) to make dispersions that were "printed"
  using electrospinning.
  The grafted polymer served as the matrix of the
  electrospun nanofiber. These types of nanocomposites have been referred
  to "matrix-free" because they are made from one component where the ZnO
  is bonded to the PMMA. The ZnO nanorods in the oriented fibers produced
  polarized emissions in the visible region of the optical spectrum when
  exposed to UV light.

**Note**:

User contributed templates are available on the

followed by this chunk. **Note:** I moved the chunk name into the block
so it will not execute here...

```
{r setup, include=FALSE}

  fig.align = "center",
#  fig.height = 6,
#  fig.width = 7,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  error = FALSE)
```

```
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert("simple.docx", "markdown", output="simple.md")

```

# Using python chunks and conda environments

1. We can pass a specific python conda environment by using
the knitr **engine.path** argument.

For example, to use the conda environment **r-tensorflow**,
we would use the following argument for **knitr**:

```
engine.path="C:/Apps/miniconda/envs/r-tensorflow/python"
```

2. Get rid of comment characters during printing

We would use the following argument for **knitr**:

```
comment=NA
```

3. Suppress annoying messages from **tensorflow**: Set the
following **environment variable**

```
TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2
```

# Splitting an ordered list

Works with a single page/slide or across slides

```
## Slide

<ol>
<li> Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error...
<li> Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit...
</ol>

This is an interrupting block of text...

<ol start=3>
<li> Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia..
<li> Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate...
</ol>

```

# Key HTML and Unicode characters


```
mu  &#x393; or &mu; Can use &Mu; for capital. 
    Unicode is \U00B5 (micro) and \U039c (upper) \U03BC (lower)
    
phi &Phi; or &phi; or \U03D5 (lower) \U03A6 (upper)

rho &Rho; or &rho; or \U03C1 (lower) \U03A1 (upper)

A-ring: &#8491;  or \U212B

degree &#176; or \U00B0

superscript 2  <sup>2</sup>  \U0032
subscript 2    <sub>2</sub>  \U2082
superscript 3  <sup>3</sup>  \U0033

```

# Custom themes

The easiest way to make a custom theme is to modify an existing one.
I modified the R vignette theme.

# Controlling image size

We can get fine control of image size like this:

1. Start by adding these packages to the first R chunk

```
library(png)
library(grid)
library(rEDS)
```

2. Include an image in a R chunk like this:

```
img <- readPNG("../path-to/foo.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

3. The header for the R-chunk might include. **Note**: Use **unique**
chunk names

```
r includeImg1, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5.625, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',
fig.cap='ImgName. 7 kV 1,000X'
```

4. I compute the fig.height from the desired width (7.5 in) and the image
   dimensions using R. For a 1024/768 image, one gets:
   
```
> 7.5*768/1024
[1] 5.625
```

# Citations

See [Citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)

At end of document add

```
last paragraph...

# References
```

Then a citation like:

```
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].
```

A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:

```
Smith says blah [-@smith04].
```

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

```
@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
