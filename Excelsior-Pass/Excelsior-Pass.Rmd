Here's now to update Excelsior pass to verify your COVID vaccine status
A new indoor mask mandate went into effect in New York Dec. 13.

Masks will be required in all indoor public places in New York unless
a business or venue opts to implement a vaccine requirement for entry,
Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Friday.

The mask requirement follows news that more than 500,000 COVID-19
vaccine booster shots were administered in the state last week.
The Food and Drug Administration has also authorized booster shots for
16-and 17-year-olds. The policy runs through Jan. 15, 2022, when the
state will reevaluate.

Here’s how those newly vaccinated or boosted individuals can verify
their vaccine status for entry into buildings and venues.

# What is the Excelsior Pass?

The Excelsior Pass launched in March and allows people to verify their
COVID-19 vaccination status on their phones when attending events in
lieu of carrying their paper vaccination card.

The pass provides a scannable QR code. The service can be used by
arenas, universities, stadiums and businesses to prove vaccination
of attendees. It can also be used to show a recent negative COVID-19
test.

# How do I get the Excelsior Pass?

Visit epass.ny.gov if you want to start the process.
What’s the process like to obtain an Excelsior Pass?

Users provide their name, date of birth, zip code and phone number.
The site then asks for the type of vaccine received and the date of
the doses. The system cross-checks the information with a state-run
immunization database and sends a verification code or voicemail to
your phone.

The pass is displayed upon confirmation and includes a QR code, name
and birthday. Your can choose to print your  pass and/or save it to
your Excelsior Pass Wallet.

# How does the Excelsior Pass Wallet work?

Users download the New York State Excelsior Pass Wallet on the Apple App
Store or Google Play store.

Open the app and add a photo of your pass or scan the QR code to upload
your pass. Or you can choose to start the entire process with the New
York State Excelsior Pass Wallet app first and then get a pass through
the app.

# Do I need a smartphone to obtain a pass?

No. The Excelsior passes can be printed and presented at venues and
businesses.

# How do venues check the pass?

Restaurants, theaters, arenas and other businesses can download the NYS
Excelsior Pass Scanner app to the QR codes on the passes. The scanner
app validates the QR code and displays if if s valid, expired or not
found. Businesses are supposed to confirm the name on someone’s pass
matches their state photo identification.

# How to Excelsior Pass different from Excelsior Pass Plus?

The Excelsior Pass holds digital proof of your COVID-19 vaccination
status or negative tests results but does not include vaccination
dates and dosage information.

Excelsior Pass Plus is like Excelsior Pass 2.0. It provides a digital
copy of your vaccination record, including vaccine type, site and dates,
just like your paper Centers for Disease Control and Prevention card.

> The inclusion of this health information enables interested New Yorkers
> to have a verifiable record of their COVID-19 vaccination history or
> negative COVID-19 test at their fingertips, for record-keeping and/or
> usage outside of New York state, the state says.
> You can print your pass or add it to your smartphone wallet on either
> pass portal.

# Will the Excelsior Pass automatically update when you get a booster?

No.

Excelsior Pass only includes a person's initial vaccination series.
To add a booster or additional dose to your pass you will need the
Excelsior Pass Plus.

# What if I can’t get the app to log my booster?

If you already have an Excelsior Pass Plus and are unable to add your
booster, the state recommends visiting epass.ny.gov to retrieve a new
pass. Users can expect their booster dose to be available 3 to 4 days
after they received the dose.

# Can I get a pass as soon as I get my shot?

Excelsior Pass Plus is available 15 days after the final dose of the
vaccine was administered. Booster shots are available 3 to 4 days
after they were administered.

# Do Excelsior passes expire?

Excelsior Pass verifications retrieved after Dec. 11 will expire on
March 31, 2022, according to the state. Excelsior Pass Plus does
not expire.

If used as a negative test verification, PCR passes are valid until
midnight on the third day after a test. Antigen passes are valid for
six hours from the time of the test.

# What if I’m from out of state?

New York state updated its scanner app to scan and validate SMART Health
Cards from other states.

# What is the vaccination rate in New York?

More than 80% of New Yorkers have at least one vaccine dose as of
Dec. 12, according to the state health department dashboard. Nearly
500,000 booster doses were distributed in the state last week,
Gov. Kathy Hochul said.
