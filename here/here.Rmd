# Info from Jenny Richmond


From [the `here` package](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/how-to-use-the-here-package/)


hi #rstats friends, how do YOU use the `here` package? I thought I had my head around it but I'm doing something wrong. Here my markdown lives within the "markdown" folder, so I set here to the "data" folder, call read_csv(here("datafile.csv") and it doesn't work... help

TFW you figure you have broken something so decide that now seems like a good time to learn `reprex`, you delete everything irrelevant to the problem out of the script and folders and then it decides to work. I should threaten my code with `reprex` more often #rstats
