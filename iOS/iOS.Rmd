# Stuck in Dark Mode

Our whole family worked to find this answer:

Happily, the [Apple Discussion](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250656701)
provided a fix: **triple-click** the **side-button** to switch the `old`
dark mode **off**. Tim thought I might have set up **invert colors**.
I do not recall doing so. I will watch for it...



# Turn off emojis

I hate the emoji keyboard. I hit it easily with my fat fingers. I turned 
it off!

1. Open iMessage.
2. Click into a random conversation thread.
3. Swipe on the app icons until you see the bubble with three dots and then tap it.
4. Select "Edit"
5. Deselect "Memoji" from both the "FAVORITES" and the "MORE APPS" section.
6. Tap "Done"
