# Current status

I installed `Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2` on my two Macbooks (BigSur) and Windows 10.

I have had problems with my newest Macbook Pro running macOS 11.4. For some
reason I cannot get Miniconda 3.9 64 bit to run without error, Miniconda 3.8
runs well enought to get work done. I have no idea how to fix this.


It looks like (2021-04-24) that I could update with

On Windows use the `Anaconda PowerShell` prompt from the menu.

1. `conda update conda`
2. `conda update --all`

I am cautious about doing this because the last time I borked the
installation.

I also noted that clicking on the `refresh` button seems to update 
`Anaconda-Navigator`.

Note that on macOS one can install python from HomeBrew.
I am running python3.9 on my 2012 MacBook Pro. Homebrew
offers this helpful hint:

```
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages

tkinter is no longer included with this formula, but it is available separately:
  brew install python-tk@3.9

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
```


## Keeping Spyder in the dock

From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQNYNRoFacA)

We need to permit applications from all developers. 
We do this from the command line:

```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```


## Finding where you are...

```
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```

## Starting Python3 on Mac

This assumes anaconda python...

In `.bash_profile` add `alias python=3.9`

start with `python3`



## Managing channels

I often want to add or remove the `conda-forge` channel...

1. Add 

    ```
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    ```

2. List

    ```
    conda config --show channels
    ```
    
3. Remove

    ```
    conda config --remove channels conda-forge
    ```

## Activating/Deactivating/deleting environments

1. Activate

    `conda activate scijava`
    
2. Deactivate

    `conda deactivate`
    
3. Delete an environment

    `conda remove -n sage --all`

## Sharing environments


From 
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41274007/anaconda-export-environment-file).

> I can't find anything in the conda specs which allow you to export an environment file without the prefix: ... line. However, as Alex pointed out in the comments, conda doesn't seem to care about the prefix line when creating an environment from file.
> 
> With that in mind, if you want the other user to have no knowledge of your default install path, you can remove the prefix line with grep before writing to environment.yml.

## A clean install of python with conda.

I prefer **a clean install** when key updates are needed
instead of accumulating many unused
packages that are not removed by `conda clean -a -y`.

This will run the `Fiji/ImageJ` tutorials using a `Groovy` kernel
in a `jupyter` notebook. This is **way cool**...

Do this periodically:

1. Download the latest miniconda installer from
[here](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/).

2. Delete the miniconda directory and all evidence
of conda:

    ```
    rm -rf minconda3 .conda .condarc
    ```
    
    Also check that conda is not in the path in
    `.bash_profile`
    
3. Install the miniconda3 environment

4. Install the desired packages. My current list is shown
below.

    ```
    # Set up a base environment
    conda update conda
    conda clean -a -y
    conda update --all
    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter spyder
    conda install sqlite pandas xlwt scikit-image nbconvert pandoc
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install mahotas sympy cython astropy
    # OPTIONALLY install pkgs suggested by Curtis Rueden
    conda install ipywidgets beakerx
    conda install octave_kernel
    pip install iversions
    cd ~/Documents/git/ezwrappers
    python setup.py install
    ```
    
    Next

    ```
    # Set up a scijava environment
    conda create -y -n scijava 'python>=3'
    source activate scijava
    conda install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions numpy openjdk=8
    conda install pyimagej python rise scikit-image
    conda install openjdk=8.0.121
    conda install notebook>=5.7.6
    conda install tornado>6
    conda install ipywidgets>=7.0.0
    conda install nodejs pandas maven
    conda install py4j requests
    conda install -c conda-forge pythreejs
    conda install beakerx
    conda install py3js
    conda install -c conda-forge ipyvolume
    conda install -c conda-forge octave_kernel
    pip install iversions
    
    conda deactivate
    
    # clean up
    conda clean -a -y
    ```
    Next
    
    ```
    cd /Users/jrminter/Documents/git/beakerx/doc/groovy
    conda activate scijava
    jupyter notebook
    
    conda deactivate
    ```

## Packages in environment at /Users/jrminter/miniconda3:
    
**2019-06-26** Current packages in base environment
    
    ```
    conda list -n base 
    ```
    
Packages are [here](./environs/base.html).
    

**2019-05-02** Current packages in scijava environment

       regarding an issue where Win10 cannot write preferences.
       
       - Go into your Start Menu and type `regedit` into the search field.
       
       - Navigate to path `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\JavaSoft`
       (Windows 10 may have this here:
        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432Node\JavaSoft`)
        
       - Right click on the `JavaSoft folder` and click on `New -> Key`
         Name the new Key `Prefs` and everything should work.

# Render obstinate `.ipynb` files to PDF


This does not work automatically. I found a workaround
[here](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

0. Install what we need from python

    See the
    [installation section](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

    **not needed** with clean install above...

    ```
    conda install nbconvert
    conda install pandoc
    ```

1. use as a command line tool

    See the
    [usage section](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

    ```
    jupyter nbconvert --to latex notebook.ipynb
    ```

2. Use LaTeX to render the notebook. `TeXworks` worked fine...

   In general, I am pleased with the rendering...
   
   There are items to add to the .tex file

# Remove PyCharm

From [blog.yinkos.com](http://blog.yinkos.com/2018/02/how-to-completely-uninstall-pycharm-on-macos/)


1. Go to Applications > right click PyCharm > move to trash

2. Open a terminal and run the following:

```
find ~/Library/ -iname "*pycharm*"
```

Verify that all of the results are in fact related to PyCharm and
not something else important you need to keep. Then, remove them
all using the command:

```
find ~/Library -iname "*pycharm*" -exec rm -r "{}" \;
```

# Setup using miniconda

`2018-08-07`: Had an issue on my Win 7 box that made me uninstall my
`Miniconda-64` miniconda environment. I had migrated to this approach
on Win 7  when installing P. Pinard's `stratgem tools` where I need to
switch environments. Note that the Avast anti-virus really slows down installs.
Rebuilt the 64 bit environment. Wanted to record the the steps.

1. Get rid of the old `Miniconda-64` environment. Use the command line
(see below) This takes a while and gives some notifications that directories
are not empty. Delete those from the File Manager at the end of the (long)
process.

    ```
    rd /s /q C:\Apps\Miniconda-64
    ```

2. Install the `Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe` base install of
`miniconda`. I install into `C:\Apps\miniconda`. At the end of the process
**rename the directory** to `Miniconda-64`. At the end of the process we will
create a link named `miniconda` in the `C:\Apps` directory using the batch file
named `setPy64.cmd` which is in the `C:\Apps\local\path` directory.

3. After the installation finishes and the link has been created, try to start
python from the command path. You should see:

    ```
    C:\Users\jrminter>python
    Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 29 2018, 13:32:41) ... on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    ```

4. Install the core python packages we will need. Add others to the list
as needed. Add others to the list (and note the date with a comment below)

    ```
    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter spyder
    conda install sqlite pandas xlwt scikit-image
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install mahotas
    conda install sympy
    conda install cython
    # this last conda suggested by Curtis Rueden
    conda install ipywidgets beakerx
    pip install iversions
    ```

5. To clean up (removing all the `.bz2` files), run

    ```
    conda clean --all
    ```

6. To remove an obsolete environment (`pweave`)

    ```
    conda env remove -n pweave
    ```


# Hints for key packages


## pandoc that will work with R-Studio

There seem to be some issues with pandoc 1.1.1 with RStudio on Windows. This version works

```
conda install pandoc=1.19.2.1
```

## matplotlib-scalebar

This is a helpful utility by Philippe Pinard. Install with

```
pip install matplotlib-scalebar
```

**Examples**:

Here is an example how to add a scale bar:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
from matplotlib_scalebar.scalebar import ScaleBar

plt.figure()
image = plt.imread(cbook.get_sample_data('grace_hopper.png'))
plt.imshow(image)
scalebar = ScaleBar(0.2) # 1 pixel = 0.2 meter
plt.gca().add_artist(scalebar)
plt.show()
```
The scale bar also works with reciprocal units,:

```
from matplotlib_scalebar.scalebar import SI_LENGTH_RECIPROCAL
scalebar = ScaleBar(0.2, '1/cm', SI_LENGTH_RECIPROCAL) # 1 pixel = 0.2 1/cm
```

## pandas

Pandas provides a dataframe structure and is useful for
many applications. There are some "gotchas". Here are
some helpful links I want to keep...

- [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
The official intro...

- [Wei-Ching Lin's](http://www.elasticmining.com/post/2015-12-24/gochas-using-pandas.html)
examples of unexpected behavior ("gotchas") encountered when using pandas.




## iversions

the **iversions** package is a small package that implements
listing of versions loaded by extending ipython magic commands.

1. clone from git repository from [here](https://github.com/iamaziz/iversions.git)
2, cd to the './git/iversions/iversions' directory
3. install with **pip install iversions**
4. use in ipython console or notebook with:

```
In [1]: %load_ext iversions

In [2]: import numpy as np
   ...: import pandas as pd
   ...: import tensorflow as tf
   ...: import os
   ...: import sys

In [3]: %iversions
numpy       1.13.1
pandas      0.20.3
tensorflow  1.3.0

Python 3.6.2 [Sun Aug 27, 2017 13:50:43]
```


# Key conda commands

**Note:** Sometimes the **conda update conda** command overwrites the miniconda
symbolic link I use to switch between 64 bit and 32 bit miniconda installs. The
solution is to delete the miniconda directory in C:/Apps and use the cmd files
to re-create the symbolic link...

I frequently need this list...

- List conda environments **conda info -e**
- Activate an environment (**source** on Win) **activate envName**
- Deactivate an environment (**source** on Win) **deactivate**
- Get other help **conda --help**
- Clean all source files: **conda clean --all** Can save > 1 Gb of space...
- To list channels:

```
conda config --get channels
```

- To **add** the **conda-forge** channel:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Likewise

```
conda config --add channels conda-canary
```

- To **remove** the **conda-forge** channel:

```
conda config --remove channels conda-forge
```

likewise

```
conda config --remove channels conda-canary
```

# > bokeh sampledata

# also ended up installing holoviews from sorce via github

deactivate py36
```

I needed an environment with the development version of scikit-image.
I cloned the py36 environment, removed the production version of scikit-image,
and installed from a fresh pull from a direct clone of the scikit-image git
repo. Note that this also pulled down a couple of dependencies
(PyWavelets-0.5.1, dask-013.0, olefile-0.44, and toolz-0.8.2).

```
conda create --name  py36-ski --clone py36
activate py36-ski
conda remove --name py36-ski scikit-image
# needed this for latest build 2017-02-20
conda install -c anaconda cython=0.25.2
# On windows note that pip cache is in
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\pip
cd %HOME%/Documents/git/scikit-image
pip install .
```

# Things that made me go "huh"...

## pyinstaller for python 3.5

From [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33168229/how-to-create-standalone-executable-file-from-python-3-5-scripts):

> You can use PyInstaller which support python 3.5. To install it with pip execute in terminal:

```
pip install pyinstaller

```


To build **makeOxfordAZtecIni.exe**: First make sure you have the environment
variable **EDS\_ROOT** set. You want everything in **EDS\_ROOT/Oxford/py** 


```
pyinstaller --onefile makeOxfordAZtecIni.py

```


## Latest Anaconda (4.2.0)

This will guarantee a **really clean** install. I discovered this by a lot of trial and error.

1. On Windows do a **complete uninstall**!

- Run the uninstaller
- Reboot
- From your user dir delete folders: **.anaconda, .ipython, .matplotlib, .spyder-xx**
- Delete the **.condarc** file from **C:\\Users\\username**
- Remove **C:\\Users\\userid\\AppData\\Local\\ContinuumIO**
- Run regedit and delete the keys **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Python** and **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Python**
- Run **ccleaner** and clean the registry
- Log off and back on
- Make sure nothing from Continuum shows up in the start menus

2. Install the x64 installer (**Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe**)

3. Move `C:\Apps\Anaconda3;C:\Apps\Anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Apps\Anaconda3\Library\bin;` to right after R in `%PATH%`

4. Install **mysql-connector**, **ezwrappers** and pip install **pyinstaller**

```
conda install mysql-connector-python
pip install pyinstaller
cd ~/Documents/git/ezwrappers
python setup.py install
conda install -c conda-forge mahotas
```

5. create an environment for **hyperspy**

```
conda create -n py35qt4 python=3.5 qt=4
source activate py35qt4
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install mysql-connector-python
conda install mahotas
conda install hyperspy
cd ~/Documents/git/jmToolsPy3
python setup.py install
# we don't want to leave this active...
conda config --remove channels conda-forge
source deactivate
```

6. When updating environments with conda, make sure you have the correct **.condarc** file:

For the **default** (root) environment:

```
channels:
  - defaults
```

For the **py35qt4** (hyperspy) environment:

```
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
```

7. I had an install fail to install the menus on my Kodak laptop. I have the shortcuts stored in my installer collection. It later turned out that not everything installed. I fixed it by doing `conda install anaconda` from the command line. The shortcuts are all to be located in this folder:

**for all user installs:**

```
%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (32-bit)  [or (64-bit)]
```

**for individual user:**

```
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (32-bit)  [or (64-bit)]
```


## possibly installing theano on Anaconda Py35

```
conda install -c jaikumarm theano=0.8.2
```

**Note:** This worked on MacOSX but **not** Win7 x64...

## installing mayavi 4.4.0 on py35

```
conda install -c menpo vtk=7.0.0
pip install mayavi

```


## matplotlib: tight_layout

From [tacaswell](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/1775)

> `tight_layout` is not the default behavior in mpl because it is not 100% reliable (there are some artists it does not know about), does not work with all ways of making axes, and requires 2 passes through the rendering to get all of the sizes right. You can pass `tight_layout=True` as a kwarg to both `plt.figure()` and `plt.subplots()`

Note that `soupault` commented:

> I always use `plt.tight_layout()` right before `savefig()` or `plt.show()` in order to get fancy spacing. Although I don't really utilize any extraordinary capabilities of matplotlib (the most "complex" are: `twinx`, `twiny`, `long ticklabels`), that is for the reasons you described above.
As far as we use only basic plotting routines in skimage gallery, this change should be sufficient.

## install a `.whl` file

Using pip

```
pip install wheel_file.whl
```

or, directly from python

```
python -m wheel install wheel_file.whl
```

convert an `.egg` file to `.whl`

```
wheel convert ./wheel_file.egg
```

Note that `.whl` files are just specially formatted `.zip` archives. Change the extension to `.zip` and we can extract/explore...

## Getting a good Anaconda set-up on Win7 x64

**NB:** If we want to pull packages from Anaconda Cloud we need to run

```
anaconda login
```

We will install the latest Anaconda Python 3.5 environment as a primary environment and use **conda** to create a Python 2.7 environment. This will provide a way to get whatever version of python you want and have them all play nicely together. We want to start with a clean slate...

1. Uninstall all system Pythons. Anaconda will replace them and let you set up environments with *conda*.
2. Run **ccleaner** and clean out the leftover cruft from the registry.
3. Install Anaconda3 2.5.0 in **C:\\Apps\\Anaconda3**
4. Move *C:\Apps\Anaconda3;C:\Apps\Anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Apps\Anaconda3\Library\bin;` to right after R in `%PATH%`
5. Run `conda update conda`
6. Run `conda update anaconda`   (does nothing at the moment, but can later...)
7. Run `conda update --all`
8. Run `conda install mysql-connector-python wheel dask`
9. Install `VisualCppBuildTools_Full.exe` to get a minimal, but sufficient VS-2015 C++ compiler. This is **much** lighter weight than `Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition`. This step is essential to build many packages (such as `skimage`) from their source (to get newer features).
10. Copy `vcbuildtoolsJM.bat` into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools`. Create a launcher with `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtoolsJM.bat"" amd64` and edit so it starts in a convenient directory (e.g. `C:\Users\my-userid\Documents\work\py3`).
11. Run `cd %GIT_HOME%\scikit-image`. Run `clean.sh`. Then run `python setup.py install` to install v.12-dev0 of scikit-image. All the tutorials use this. Not sure why they have not released it...
12. Fix path in `startMIDB3.bat`.
13. Run `cd %GIT_HOME%\OSImageAnalysis\py2\yml`.
14. Run `conda env create -f py27.yml`. This creates a `Python 2.7` environment.
15. For some reason, `juypter` is not properly installed from the `.yml` file, so run `conda install jupyter`. This installs jupyter and all the dependencies.
16. Copy `vcvarsallJM.bat` into `C:\Users\my-user-id\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0` and set up on the desktop a launcher with `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k ""C:\Users\l837410\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsallJM.bat" amd64"`. Edit the batch file so that it starts in a convenient directory (e.g. `C:\Users\my-userid\Documents\work\py2`). **Note:** For some reason `%comspec%` doesn't work on `ROCPW7ZC5C423`.... This `.bat` file sets the environment variables, changes to the desired directory,  and activates py27.
17. Run `cd %GIT_HOME%\hyperspy`, then `git reset --hard; git checkout master`
18. Install hyperspy from command line:  `python setup install`.

## Downloads

```
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

url = 'http://cook.msm.cam.ac.uk//~hyperspy//EDS_tutorial//'
files = ['Ni_superalloy_1pix.msa', 'Ni_superalloy_010.rpl',
         'Ni_superalloy_010.raw']
for file in files:
    urlretrieve(url + file, file)
```

## Strings

- `r'$+\pi/2$'` - a `raw string`, where backslashes are not escaped. In this case this would be useful for an axis label in `matplotlib`.

- `u'  '` a unicode string.
- `ur'xxx' - a unicode raw string.



## Launching

On MacOSX, a recent update broke the launcher for spyder,
glueviz,and qtconsole. In reality, it is easier to use the Finder
to navigate to the desired directory, use the `cd to.app` to open
a terminal in that directory and start with one of

```
ipython qtconsole
ipython notebook
spyder
```

Note that starting `launcher` from the terminal makes the
graphical start work. Go figure...

## Updating

```
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
```

To update all packages

```
conda update --all
```

## Environments

The definitive guide is [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)

### To list all environments

```
conda info --envs
```
or

```
conda env list
```
### To activate/deactivate an environment

On Windows

```
activate name

deactivate
```

On MacOSX/Linux

```
source activate name

source deactivate
```

### To list a detailed package list for an environment

```
conda list -e
```

### To create an environment

From the command line...

```
conda create --name myEnv python=3 scipy otherpackage
```

or from a yaml file

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Export this file with from the active environment

```
conda env export > myName.yml
```

Remove an environment

```
conda remove --name theName --all
```

# iPython Notebook

Some hints from version 3.

- `--pylab` flag has been disabled as a flag; one should use
`%pylab` or `%matplotlib` in the notebook to enable matplotlib. 

- `--notebook-dir=<Unicode> (NotebookApp.notebook_dir)` the 
default is `u''`. This is the directory to use for notebooks
and kernels.  If one starts from the Anaconda Launcher, it seems
to start in one's home directory. One can navigate to the
desired folder.

## ipython4 and jupyter

Jupyter must be installed separately. See [jupyter github](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)

An easy way to update after **the big split** from [blog.jupyter.org](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/08/12/first-release-of-jupyter/)

```
pip install --upgrade ipython[all]  
```

or BF&I

```
# ensure setuptools/pip are up-to-date
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/jupyter/notebook.git
cd notebook
pip install --pre -e .
jupyter notebook
```
## Polished jupyter notebooks


### Matplotlib tricks

From [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IPython/comments/36p360/try_matplotlib_notebook_for_interactive_plots/)

> The old `%matplotlib inline` activates the inline backend, which renders figures in the notebook as static pngs.

If one wants to convert the notebook to PDF, this is the desired option

> The new `%matplotlib notebook` activates the nbagg backend, added in matplotlib 1.4, which will include a javascript interface for interaction with inline figures in the notebook. This only works in IPython >= 3.x;

This is a great option for notebooks that will remain in html format

### Optionally visible code

From [Chris Said](http://chris-said.io/2016/02/13/how-to-make-polished-jupyter-presentations-with-optional-code-visibility/) 2016-02-13.

To make the code optionally visible, available at the click of a button, include a raw cell at the beginning of your notebook containing the JavaScript and HTML below. This code sample is inspired by a [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27934885/how-to-hide-code-from-cells-in-ipython-notebook-visualized-with-nbviewer) post, but makes a few improvements such as using a raw cell so that the button position stays fixed, changing the button text depending on state, and displaying gradual transitions so the user understands what is happening.

```
<script>
  function code_toggle() {
    if (code_shown){
      $('div.input').hide('500');
      $('#toggleButton').val('Show Code')
    } else {
      $('div.input').show('500');
      $('#toggleButton').val('Hide Code')
    }
    code_shown = !code_shown
  }

  $( document ).ready(function(){
    code_shown=false;
    $('div.input').hide()
  });
</script>
<form action="javascript:code_toggle()"><input type="submit" id="toggleButton" value="Show Code"></form>
```

It’s pretty straightforward to remove the extra elements like the header, footer, and prompt numbers. That being said, you may want to still include some attribution to the Jupyter project and to your free hosting service. To do all of this, just include a raw cell at the end of your notebook with some more JavaScript.

```
<script>
  $(document).ready(function(){
    $('div.prompt').hide();
    $('div.back-to-top').hide();
    $('nav#menubar').hide();
    $('.breadcrumb').hide();
    $('.hidden-print').hide();
  });
</script>

<footer id="attribution" style="float:right; color:#999; background:#fff;">
Created with Jupyter, delivered by Fastly, rendered by Rackspace.
</footer>
```

One shortcoming with what we have so far is that users may still see some code or other unwanted elements while the page is loading. This can be especially problematic if you have a long presentation with many plots. To avoid this problem, add a raw cell at the very top of your notebook containing a preloader. This example preloader includes an animation that signals to users that the page is still loading. It heavily inspired by [this preloader](http://codepen.io/mimoYmima/pen/fisgL) created by [@mimoYmima](https://twitter.com/@mimoYmima).

```
<script>
  jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

  $(window).load(function(){
    $('#preloader').fadeOut('slow',function(){$(this).remove();});
  });

  });
</script>

<style type="text/css">
  div#preloader { position: fixed;
      left: 0;
      top: 0;
      z-index: 999;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      overflow: visible;
      background: #fff url('http://preloaders.net/preloaders/720/Moving%20line.gif') no-repeat center center;
  }

</style>

<div id="preloader"></div>
```

To work with these notebooks, you can clone my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csaid/polished_notebooks). While the notebooks render correctly on nbviewer ([unpolished](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csaid/polished_notebooks/blob/master/notebook_original.ipynb), [polished](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/csaid/polished_notebooks/blob/master/notebook_polished.ipynb)), they do not render correctly on the GitHub viewer.


## Problems with ipynb conversions to PDF

It did not like this kind of markdown:

```
data type, `'uint8'` (unsigned, 8-bit integer)
```
produced this $\LaTeX$

```
data type, \texttt{\textquotesingle{}uint8\textquotesingle{}} (unsigned, 8-bit integer)
```

gave the error:

```
LaTeX Error: Command \textquotesingle unavailable in encoding OT1.
```

but this was OK

```
 data type, `uint8` (unsigned, 8-bit integer)
```

I diagnosed this by converting to $\LaTeX$ with this command

```
ipython nbconvert --to latex 01_color_and_exposure.ipynb
```

and processing the $\LaTeX$

One directly converts to pdf with

```
ipython nbconvert --to pdf 01_color_and_exposure.ipynb
```

Note that Fernando Perez shows a useful Makefile for replacement 
[here](https://github.com/ipython/sloan-2013-reports/blob/master/Makefile).

Here is one I wrote that let me edit the $\LaTeX$ file in between

```
# in
# /Users/jrminter/src/py2/tstMakePdfFromIpynb
BASE=demonstrateEigenValues

all: $(BASE).pdf

$(BASE).tex: $(BASE).ipynb
	ipython nbconvert --to latex $(BASE).ipynb

## Checking outdated packages

## Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7

### Installing and Uninstalling

The compiler package will default to installing just for the current user and does not require administrative privileges. To install for all users of a machine, execute `msiexec /i <path to MSI> ALLUSERS=1` from an elevated Command Prompt.

To remove or repair the compiler package, locate the entry in Programs and Features and select Remove or Repair.

### Using with Python distribution tools
Python package developers should download and use this compiler to produce binary wheels for their Python packages to upload to PyPI. Installing the wheel package, updating to setuptools 6.0 or later, and adding setup.py bdist_wheel upload to your build process will produce the correct files (remember to do this for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions).

If a Python package you are installing does not have a wheel, you can install this compiler package on your own machine. Once the compiler is installed and you have updated to setuptools 6.0 or later, you can use pip install to build and install the Python package. If you are managing multiple machines and need to install the Python package on all of them, you should install the wheel package and use pip wheel to produce a wheel that can be installed on machines without requiring this package.

## installing from git repos

For python 3
```
$ cd repo
$ pip3 install -e ./
```

For python 2
```
$ cd repo
$ pip install -e ./
```

## Uninstalling Python 3.4.1 on Win7 x64

Following the hints below:

1. I uninstalled all other installed py34 pgms. Uninstalled 3.4.1. Failed.
2. Did a regedit search for **Python 3.4.1  **and deleted all keys
3. Did a **Python  **search and deleted all keys
4. Ran CCCleaner and cleaned all
5. Deleted everything in Python34 except empty Scripts folder
6. Restarted
7. Ran CCCleaner and cleaned all
8. Installed 3.4.2

Not the first person to run into this problem. Found [this](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/1157273)

## Fixing python-win32 on python 3.4

From [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22490233/win32com-import-error-python-3-4)

We need to re-run the install script to get **import win32wnet  **to work.

```
python C:\Python34\Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
```

# Getting Python 2 and 3 to play well with Win7
There was a great discussion on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15912063/how-do-i-run-python-2-and-3-in-windows-7) that suggested the [Python launcher for Windows](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/) introduced in Python 3. The documentation is on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/src/tip/Doc/launcher.rst).

## Building Python Extensions on Win 7 x64

One must precisely match the compiler used to
build the binaries. For Python 3.3, this is
Visual Studio 2010.  I did a custom install of
Visual Studio 2010 Premium to get the x64 compilers
installed. I also installed Service Pack 1 and
the x64 redistributable package.

### Get the environment variables set

The easiest way to do this is to use the **Visual
Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt  **command window.

### Example: compiling the 0.10 dev version of scikit-image

1. I started the **x64 Win64 Command Prompt**
2. I downloaded the source from github.
3. When I first tried **python setup.py build** it complained about missing the cython dependency.
4. I did **pip3 install cython** from the command window.
5. On my second attempt at **python setup.py build** I got an error complaining about undefined **M_PI**. This should have been picked up by **include math.h** but was not. I placed this in the two affected files

```
#ifndef M_PI
  #define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846
#endif
```

This built and installed without further error messages.


## GUI
### Eclipse
#### Install from PyDev
Install from update site **http://pydev.org/updates``
### Color themes
Install from update site **http://eclipse-color-theme.github.io/update/``

They have a nice Sublime Text 2 theme

## Directory operations

### get the current working directory
```
import os
os.getcwd()
```
### remove an entire tree
```
import shutil
shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None)
```

## ini files
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8884188/how-to-read-and-write-ini-file-with-python)

```
import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read('FILE.INI')
print(config['DEFAULT']['path'])     # -> "/path/name/"
config['DEFAULT']['path'] = '/var/shared/'    # update
config['DEFAULT']['default_message'] = 'Hey! help me!!'   # create

with open('FILE.INI', 'w') as configfile:    # save
    config.write(configfile)
```

Seems to work fine...

## List Comprehensions

From [Carl Groner](http://carlgroner.me/Python/2011/11/09/An-Introduction-to-List-Comprehensions-in-Python.html)

### The basics.
Let’s start with a simple list.

```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Quite often, we’ll need to build a new list from the elements of an existing list. For example, let’s say we want to make a list containing all elements of **my_list``, each multiplied by 2. 

### Using Python's List Comprehension
Now let’s take a look at how to do this using Python’s list comprehension syntax.

```
>>> new_list = [x * 2 for x in my_list]
>>> new_list
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```
### Syntax
The syntax for list comprehension is based on set builder notation. Given the form **[Y for X in LIST]**, **Y** is commonly referred to as the **output function** , **X** is the ***variable***, and **LIST** is the **input set**. This statement says to do **Y** on each **X** in **LIST**.

For an example of using a different output function, let’s say say we want a new list that contains each number in **my_list** as a string type…

```
>>> [str(x) for x in my_list]
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
```

You may be asking yourself why we wouldn't just use **map()** here:

```
>>> map(str, my_list)
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
```

In this example, **map** looks like a good alternative. However, for slightly more complicated requirements, list comprehension can be a bit more concise. For example, when we’d like to specify a predicate .

### The predicate
Consider our previous example, where we want to create a list of string types for each element in **my_list``, except this time we only want the elements which are even numbers. A typical way to do this would be:

```
>>> new_list = []
>>> for x in my_list:
...   if (x % 2) == 0:
...     new_list.append(str(x))
... 
>>> new_list
['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']
```

In order to use map() here we would need to first filter the list to exclude the odd numbers.

Using the list comprehension syntax would look like this:

```
>>> new_list = [str(x) for x in my_list if (x % 2) == 0]
>>> new_list
['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']
```

This version introduces the predicate, an expression after the list which acts as a filter on which elements get passed to the output function.

Neat, clear and concise.

### Loops of loops.
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that you can use list comprehensions to iterate on more than one list. For example:

```
>>> list_a = ['A', 'B']
>>> list_b = [1, 2]
>>> [(x, y) for x in list_a for y in list_b]
[('A', 1), ('A', 2), ('B', 1), ('B', 2)]
```

Just like you would expect in for loops, the last loop moves the fastest. Also note that this method returns a list of tuples. If you’d like nested lists, you can also nest one list comprehension within another.

```
>>> list_a = ['A', 'B']
>>> list_b = ['C', 'D']
>>> [[x+y for x in list_a] for y in list_b]
[['AC', 'BC'], ['AD', 'BD']]
```

### Summary.

List comprehension in Python can often provide a neat, clear, and concise syntax for creating lists from other lists. However, one should always be aware that, particularly for complex transformations or predicates, the concise and terse syntax can quickly become very difficult to read. In these cases, it's often beneficial to revert to traditional looping constructs.

[this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4960048/python-3-and-mysql)
suggested that

> You should probably use pymysql - Pure Python MySQL
> client instead. It works with Python 3.x, and doesn't
> have any dependencies.
> 
> This pure Python MySQL client provides a DB-API to a
> MySQL database by talking directly to the server via
> the binary client/server protocol.
>
> Example:

```
import pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', unix_socket='/tmp/mysql.sock', user='root', passwd=None, db='mysql')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT Host,User FROM user")
for r in cur:
    print(r)
cur.close()
conn.close()

```

They offered the link to
[gohkle's](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
Win binaries. Currently (2013-06-01), the list doesn't
list py3.2 binaries. I do note that there are py3.2
binaries for Oursql that claims to support MySQL
databases
see [this example](http://pythonhosted.org/oursql/tutorial.html#establishing-a-connection).
