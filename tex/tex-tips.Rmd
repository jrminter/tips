These are John Minter's tips for a workflow using TeXlive.
They were compiled from several web sources.

# Simple tricks

## delete texlive backups

From [stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/172626/backups-for-tlpkg-during-tlmgr-update).    
Set `clean=0` to delete all; `clean=1` will keep a single backup. I use:

```
tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all
```


## tlmgr complains about gpg key

See [www.preining.info](http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/) for details.

On Windows, one can do a one-time install:

```
tlmgr --repository http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/ install tlgpg
```

Note: Avast complains...


## Spacing in math mode

From [emerson.emory.edu](http://www.emerson.emory.edu/services/latex/latex_119.html):

In a **math environment**, $\LaTeX$ ignores the spaces you type and puts in
the spacing that it thinks is best. $\LaTeX$ formats mathematics the way
it's done in mathematics texts. If you want different spacing, $\LaTeX$
provides the following four commands for use in math mode:


1. `\;` - a thick space
2. `\:` - a medium space
3. `\,` - a thin space
4. `\!` - a negative thin space

## Encoding

Herb Schulz noted the directive for Unicode at the top of a file

```
% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

## Spell Check for TexWorks

From [tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/235313/how-to-add-spell-checker-to-texworks-on-windows)

1. Download the dictionary corresponding to your desired language from the OpenOffice.org extensions [site](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/search?f%5B0%5D=field_project_tags%3A157).
2. Change the file extension of the downloaded file from .oxt to .zip and extract the files with your archive utility of choice.
3. Open TeXworks and select `Settings and Resources` from the Help menu. A dialog window will open with a link to the TeXworks resources folder.
4. Click the link to open the resources folder. If there is no dictionaries subfolder there yet, then create it now. Open the (possibly newly created) dictionaries subfolder.
5. Copy the `.dic` and `.aff` files from the downloaded .zip file to the dictionaries subfolder.
6. Close and reopen TeXworks. The dictionaries should be listed under the Spelling item in the Edit menu.


## TinyTex and BasicTex

See [Yihui's write-up](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) and the
[github repository](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex). On Windows,
TinyTeX installs to the user's `%APPDATA%/TinyTeX` folder.

Note Bob Rudis and Noam Ross recommended BasicTex.
It can be installed on a Mac with `homebrew`. Note how one can
install a few packages manually. Keeps the footprint down...

```
brew install gnupg
brew cask install basictex # suggested by @noamross
# plus the following, provided by Kras.Pten
# read why here: http://rud.is/b/2015/10/22/installing-r-on-os-x-100-homebrew-edition/#comment-10603
sudo tlmgr update –-self 
sudo tlmgr update –-all 
sudo tlmgr install titling framed inconsolata
```

### Paths on Windows

I have both TinyTex (TL2018) and a full TL2018 installation on my Win10 VM.
I can switch them by changing the path in my environment string...

The binary paths are:

1. TinyTeX

```
%APPDATA%\TinyTeX\bin\win32
```

2. TexLive2018

```
C:\Apps\texlive\2018\bin\win32
```


### Set the repository

```
tlmgr option repository http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```
### To install TexWorks

```
tlmgr install animate graphicx color ifthen texworks media9 ocgx2
```

### To install Yihui's favorite packages

```
tlmgr install a4wide ae algorithms appendix babel-english bbm-macros
tlmgr install beamer breakurl catoptions charter cite cleveref colortbl
tlmgr install comment courier dvips eepic enumitem eso-pic eurosym
tlmgr install extsizes fancyhdr float floatrow fontaxes hardwrap helvetic
tlmgr install inconsolata koma-script lastpage lettrine libertine lipsum
tlmgr install listings ltxkeys ly1 mathalfa mathpazo mathtools mdframed
tlmgr install mdwtools microtype morefloats ms multirow mweights ncntrsbk
tlmgr install needspace newtx ntgclass palatino parskip pbox pdfpages pgf
tlmgr install picinpar preprint preview psnfss roboto sectsty setspace siunitx
tlmgr install srcltx standalone stmaryrd sttools subfig subfigure symbol
tlmgr install tabu tex textcase threeparttable thumbpdf times titlesec
tlmgr install tufte-latex ucs ulem units varwidth vmargin wallpaper
tlmgr install wrapfig xargs xcolor xstring xwatermark
# found these later to work with TexWorks...
tlmgr install tocloft tocloft
```

### Fixing errors

Yihui recommends:

```
tlmgr update --self --all
tlmgr path add
fmtutil-sys --all

```

## XeLaTeX slows down when it encounters a .fd file

This is particularly bad on Windows. The solution came from [stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/57204/different-compilation-times-with-different-operating-systems). The issue is the font cache. the solution is to run the following command from an **Administrator Command Prompt**

```
fc-cache -fv
```

**Note:** [This](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/325278/xelatex-runs-slow-on-windows-machine) thread on StackOverflow notes that it **really helps** to run XeLaTeX as an administrator. It helps to run make from an an **Administrator Command Prompt**.



## HTML Colors
These are frequently used in themes.
[ColorPicker](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp)

## Hyphenation

From [Malaysian LaTeX UG](http://latex-my.blogspot.com/2015/09/rant-warning-i-dont-want-hyphenation-in.html)

>  A quick way to disable hyphenation is to put `\sloppy` just after your `\begin{document}`.

## Spacing

From [TeX Tips](https://twitter.com/TeXtip/status/599224090004697088)

Use `\phantom{}` to insert white space the size of the argument. 
For example, `\phantom{\sum}` is an invisible `\sum`.

## Choose the program to compile

Add the following at the top of the `*.tex` file, choosing the desired program (pdflatex, xelatex):

```
%!TEX program = xelatex
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

The second line will let one use Unicode characters in XeLaTeX.

## XeLaTeX resources

Great, short intros by [Rob Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/xelatex/) and
[LingSUN](http://lingsun.altervista.org/xelatex/), and
[Deep Core](http://blog.deepcore.gr/?p=243)

[Markus Gesmann](http://www.magesblog.com/2011/10/using-sweave-with-xelatex.html) has a great example of using XeLaTeX with Sweave, with the source on [github](https://gist.github.com/mages/1307543) as a gist.

Lots of info in the [fontspec manual](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fontspec/fontspec.pdf)

There is the XeTeX

home page and the 
[sourceforge](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) home page
and the mailing list [archives](http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/)



## Hide the page number on first page of a chapter

```
\thispagestyle{empty}
my text
\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}

```

## Proper links to items in a list

Sime Ungar explained this on the `macos-tex` list on 2018-07-09.

>  I have a rather long itemized list extending several pages, each 
> `\item` labeled differently, and in other parts of my document I want
> to use `\pageref` to link (I am using the hyperref package) the page of
> the corresponding `\item`. The number of the respective page produced
> by `\pageref` is correct, but clicking the link opens the page of the
> first \item which is several pages before the correct page.
> This occurs regardless of whether I use MacTeX 2017 or 2018.
> How should I make the correct link?

Sime later shares the answer:

> Instead of `itemize` use `enumerate`, and if you do not want the
> numbers, instead of just `\item` use `\item[$\bullet$]`.




## Compressing pdflatex output with ghostscript

```
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=compressed.pdf orig.pdf
```

## Crop pdf margina
```
pdfcrop --margins 4 orig.pdf cropped.pdf
```

## Multiple files

There are three ways to put subfile.tex file into main.tex:

```
\include{"filename"}
\input{"filename"}
\import{"path"}{"filename"}
```

* ``\import`` needs ``\usepackage{import}``.
* ``\include`` is only used in the main.tex and cannot be used in subfile.tex
* ``\input`` can be used in main.tex or subfile.tex.

__Note:__ It took me quie a while to discover that I needed to use ``\input`` instead of ``\include`` in a Sweave file to get references to work properly with a table previously written with ``xtable``.

use ``\import`` for absolute paths or ``\subimport`` relative paths
if you want to nest imports, and want the imported file (first level)
to use its own path as the base for further imports (second level). 
see [stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58485/14697)

## Getting figure numbers correct
Some old but excellent advice from
[Luke Maciak](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/04/14/latex-fixing-wrong-figure-numbers/)

What I tell you right now may save you hours of extensive
debugging, cursing under your breath, commenting out custom
code dealing with figure layout and much frustration.

Whenever you use figures, always (and I mean ALWAYS EVER
FOREVER ALWAYS) put ``\caption`` first, and ``\label``
second like this:

```
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
 		\includegraphics{image.eps}
 	\caption{Some Image} 	% \caption IS ALWAYS FIRST
 	\label{fig:some-image} 	% \label IS ALWAYS SECOND
\end{figure}
```
Easy way to remember this -- order your image tags alphabetically.
C goes before L. Always. No exception.

If you put the ``\label`` above ``\caption`` you will run into
trouble when referencing figures inside subsections. In my case,
the caption underneath the figure would say Fig. 4.2 but the
output of ``\ref`` would be 4.3.10 because somehow it was picking
up the section numbers wrong. The whole damn chapter 4 had the
caption/label pairs flipped – but the rest of the document was
fine. I have no clue what possessed me to write it this way.

Now I know better. This is the 3 hours of my life that I will
never get back. All because I put label before a caption.
Do not do that to yourself!

# Citations

## Hiding citations
A useful hint from
[texblog.org](http://texblog.org/2014/08/05/undefining-a-command-in-latex/)

> I was editing a poster and didn't know whether or not to include a bibliography. I had already added ``\cite`` commands and wanted to get an idea of what it looks like without bibliography. So I commented out ``\printbiliography`` to get rid of the bibliography, but the numbers were still in the text. Removing all ``\cite`` commands wasn't an option in case I wanted to have them back. The solution was to overwrite ``\cite`` with a command that's defined, but does nothing:

```
\let\cite\empty
```
This did the trick!


## Citations in figures

Another old but useful tip from
[Luke Maciak](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2006/07/26/latex-citations-in-figures/)

For some unknown, mysterious reason you can’t put a ``\cite``
command as an argument of the ``\caption`` statement. I stumbled
upon this today when I was trying to attribute an image that I
shamelessly 'snurched' from the web.

Apparently, the cause is not as mysterious as I thought. If you
want to know why this happens, do some research on
``fragile commands and moving arguments``. Do you need to
understand these things throughly? Probably not. You just
need to remember that you may sometimes need to protect a
``\cite`` when it is an attribute of something else:

```
\caption{Very Stupid Image \protect\cite{source}}
```

So here is a new rule of thumb: if you nest a command in
an attribute of another command and latex freaks out, you
might be dealing with a fragile command inside of a moving
attribute. Sticking a ``\protect`` in front of the command
is a good place to start troubleshooting the problem.

### Update 12/15/2006 04:03:46 PM

One caveat here -– if you put citations in image captions, then
they will show up in your list of figures. This looks a little
ugly, and it can mess up your citation order. For example,
if you use IEEEtran.bst for your BibTex formating, then the
first cited source should be ``[1]``, second source should be
``[2]`` and etc... Unfortunately if your list of figures is on
page 3, then the first citation on that page will be counted
as ``[1]`` even if the actual image does not show up till
page 64.

So be careful with these.

### Update 01/08/2007 10:05:32 AM

I figured out the caption and the list of figures issue. It
turns out that ``\caption`` can take an optional parameter
which is the text for the list like so:

```
\caption[Stupid Image]{Stupid Image \protect\cite{source}}
```

If you use it this way the citation only shows up under the
figure, but not in the LoF and thus the order of references
is preserved.


# Avoiding Sweave...

Sometimes it is helpful to write a table from R to be included.
Even if one uses Sweave for some tasks, this trick can make
the file shorter...


```{r}
library(xtable)
df <- data.frame(one=c(1,2,3),
                 two=c(1,2,3),
                 three=c(1,2,3),
                 four=c(1,2,3))

tab.tex  <- './tab.tex'
o.names <- colnames(df)
# if one wants clean column names...
n.names <- c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro")
colnames(df) <- n.names
# note ncol+1 entries
dig <- c(0,1,1,1,1)
xt <- xtable(df, digits = dig,
             caption = "My table.",
             label = "tab:myTab",
             table.placement = "tbp",
             caption.placement = "top",
             size = "small",
             table.placement="ht")

sink(tab.tex)
# change rownames to TRUE if meaningful
print(xt, include.rownames=FALSE)
sink()

# the lets one include the file...
str.ei <- '\\endinput'
cat(str.ei, file=tab.tex, sep='\n', append=TRUE)


```

# System Administration

## Spaces in file names

Some packages have problems with paths with spaces on Windoze

Typical culprits are ("Program Files", "Documents and Settings")
so I like a non-standard install. I do this for R as well...
I also switch using environment variables.

```
C:/Apps/texlive/
C:/Apps/texlive/2015
C:/Apps/texlive/texmf-local

C:/Apps/R/R-3.1.3
C:/Apps/R/R-3.2.0
C:/Apps/R/Rtools

```



## Regenerating config files

```
tlmgr generate language
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def
tlmgr generate fmtutil
fmtutil-sys --all
tlmgr generate updmap
updmap-sys
```

## finding locations
**Q:** does anyone know how to ask an existing TL installation
where it has placed the equivalents of texmf-var and
texmf-config?? i.e. if the users has used the advanced
installer to place things in alternative locations?

**A:** from Norbert Preining (preining@logic.at).

```
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG
```

The -var-value was introduced to make lookups easier
on Windows, which has horrible quoting rules.

```
tlmgr option location http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```

```
tlmgr option location  http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```

## Initial Install

## TexWorks autocompletion
[TexDev](http://www.texdev.net/2013/09/01/customising-texworks-auto-completion/)

[TexWorks wiki](https://code.google.com/p/texworks/wiki/CodeCompletion)

TeXworks uses a simple list of simple completion options.
The basic format for the auto-complete files is to have a
first line for the encoding

```
%% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

then one or more lines for each completion. Each line can
either just have a completion value

```
\alpha
```

or have a ***shortcut*** text version

```
xa:=\alpha
```

There are then a few bits of 'helper' syntax. You can use
``#INS#`` to show where the cursor should end up, ``#RET``
for a return and Unicode character U+2022 (BULLET)
as a marker you can jump to using 
``Ctrl-Tab`` (``Option-Tab`` on the Mac). So for example
the ``\documentclass`` lines read

```
\documentclass{#INS#}#RET#
\documentclass[#INS#]{•}#RET#
```


## a libpng issue

During the pretest of TL2013, an issue was noted by
Werner Lemberg (wl.gnu.org) regarding a bug in some
recent versions of libpng.

> ...  a serious bug introduced in 1.6.0 (and
> fixed in 1.6.2) causing the creation of invalid files.

Werner recommends updaing to 1.6.2, but this is causing the
issues for the TL 2013 developers. Werner did suggest this
workaround...

> BTW, the libpng issue can be fixed by running the
> `png-fix-too-far-back' binary (which comes with recent
> libpng versions) on affected PNG images, and I was able
> to successfully continue my lilypond build after doing this.
