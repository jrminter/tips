**Update**: had issues with TinyTeX. Decided to use MacTeX 2021 on Apple and
TexLive on Windows. Did this on 2021-04-08. A **long** day.

These are John Minter's tips for a workflow using TinyTeX or
in Rmarkdown. They were compiled from several web sources.

# Keep current installation updated

This works on Windows and Mac (don't use `sudo` on Windows...)

1. `sudo tlmgr update --self`
2. `sudo tlmgr update --all`

To use the R package `tikzDevice` install (thanks, Yihui ):

```
tlmgr install pgf preview xcolor
```



# Current odd behavior:

macBook Pro - TexWorks 0.7 "travis-ci" runs on macOS Big Sur 11.2.3
macBook Pro 2020 - TexShop 4.62 runs 11.2.3. Texworks has an error.

I do not know why...

# Location of LaTeX examples

There are examples on my MacBook at     
`/Users/myuserid/Dropbox/Tex` 

There are some examples on my old MacBook at    
`/Users/myuserid/Documents/tex/`

There on my Windows 10 box are at    
`/C:/Users/myuserid/Documents/TeX`

# My favorite mirror

```
tlmgr option repository https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/systems/texlive/tlnet
```
All three of my installations use this.

# Tips from Yihui Xie

Now I only have one last wish for TeX Live: I wish it could install
missing packages on-the-fly like MiKTeX when compiling documents. I
do not know how MiKTeX implemented it. I'm primarily an R @R-base
package developer. I do not know much about the TeX language or Perl.
**I know how to search for the package that contains a certain style**
**or class file and install it, e.g.**,

```
$ tlmgr search --global --file "/times.sty"
psnfss:
      texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/times.sty
```

Followed by:

```
$ tlmgr install psnfss
```


# Fun with TinyTeX

Note that in early April TexLive (and TinyTex) make their yearly
switch. Sometimes it pays to be patient... This is a work in progress...

## Repository

```
https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/texlive/tlnet
```

I used TinyTeX

Note: I tried adding koma-script:

> The KOMA-Script bundle provides replacements for the article, 
> report, and book classes with emphasis on typography and versatility.

```
tlmgr install koma-script
```

## Some commands

```
tinytex::install_tinytex(version = 'latest')
```

```
tinytex::uninstall_tinytex(force = FALSE, dir = tinytex_root()
```

```
reinstall_tinytex(packages = TRUE, dir = tinytex_root(), ...)
```

```
tinytex_root(error = TRUE)
```

A one time need:

```
tlmgr --repository http://www.texlive.info/tlgpg/ install tlgpg
```

# Texworks on mac

Use TexWorks 0.6.3 on MacOS BigSur

# A simple install of TinyTeX

From the R Command prompt (`>`) type

```
tinytex:::install_prebuilt()
```

can also try

```
tinytex::install_tinytex(version = "2021.04")
```

For my needs to get TeXworks running, I needed to add the following
packages with `tlmgr install pkgname` without the `.sty` extension.

On Windows-10 I used the Powershell as an administrator.

I needed these packages:

```
texworks, paralist, subfig, caption, fancyhdr, secsty, tocbibind,
tocloft, grfext
```

Find a package

```
```



The full install of TexLive or MacTex are huge. Most packages
are not needed. Yihui Xie's `TinyTex` is a good solution. One
can start with the command below. One can add additional packages
using `tlmgr install package_name`.

The full commands are available
[here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html).

Looks like Windows works well with TexWorks and Mac works with TexShop...

Use these commands to install packages...

# found these later to work with TexWorks...
tlmgr install tocloft tocloft
```

# For TexWorks

As per the TeXworks manual, the procedure to install spell checking
dictionaries in TeXworks is as follows.

1. Download the dictionary corresponding to your desired language from
the OpenOffice.org extensions site.

2. Change the file extension of the downloaded file from .oxt to .zip
and extract the files with your archive utility of choice.

3. Open TeXworks and select Settings and Resources from the Help menu.
A dialog window will open with a link to the TeXworks resources folder.

4. Click the link to open the resources folder. If there is no
dictionaries subfolder there yet, then create it now. Open the (possibly
newly created) dictionaries subfolder.

5. Copy the .dic and .aff files from the downloaded .zip file to the
dictionaries subfolder. Close and reopen TeXworks. The dictionaries
should be listed under the Spelling item in the Edit menu.

# Simple tricks

## A simple install of TinyTeX

From the R Command prompt (`>`) type

```
tinytex:::install_prebuilt()
```


## A bare install of TinyTeX


See [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) for details.

This morning an update of TexLive 2020` borked my installation.
The big distribution is a bemhouth with lots of packages I don't use.
I used this as an opportunity to switch to Yihui Xie's `TinyTex`.
I got a working environment with 213 packages and a total size of 
423 MB.

I saved the contents of the TinyTeX folder and the contents of the
.texlive2020 (looks like old sagetex preferences?) from my user folder.
I had issues with sagetex... What I really needed was `a basic working
LaTeX installation`!


## Adding packages

Do it in batch...

```

tlmgr install a4wide ae algorithms appendix babel-english bbm-macros beamer breakurl catoptions charter cite cleveref colortbl comment courier dvips eepic enumitem eso-pic eurosym

tlmgr install extsizes fancyhdr float floatrow fontaxes hardwrap helvetic inconsolata koma-script lastpage lettrine libertine lipsum listings ltxkeys ly1 mathalfa mathpazo mathtools mdframed mdwtools microtype morefloats ms multirow mweights ncntrsbk

tlmgr install needspace newtx ntgclass palatino


tlmgr install parskip pbox pdfpages pgf picinpar preprint preview psnfss roboto sectsty setspace

tlmgr install siunitx srcltx standalone stmaryrd sttools subfig subfigure symbol tabu tex textcase threeparttable thumbpdf times titlesec

tlmgr install tufte-latex ucs ulem units varwidth vmargin wallpaper wrapfig xargs xcolor xstring xwatermark tocloft

## Add a spell-checker to TexWorks

[Add a spell-checker to TexWorks](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/235313/how-to-add-spell-checker-to-texworks)



## For PDF documents

Both LaTeX (and Rmarkdown to get PDF) can use

```
\fontsize{16}{19.2}
\fontseries{r}
\selectfont

```
 In general, the 2nd argument of `fontsize` should be `1.6*1st`.

```
Series, any combination of weight and width is [in theory]
possible:

weight                    width
Ultra Light       ul      Ultra Condensed     uc    
Extra Light       el      Extra Condensed     ec    
Light             l       Condensed            c      
Semi Light        sl      Semi Condensed      sc    
Medium (normal)   m
Semi Bold         sb      Semi Expanded       sx    
Bold              b       Expanded             x 
Extra Bold        eb      Extra Expanded      ex 
Ultra Bold        ub      Ultra Expanded      ux
Shape:

upright (normal)   n 
italic             it
slanted/oblique    sl 
small caps         sc
upright italic     ui
outline            ol 

```



## Using TinyTeX

Note that TexLive 2020 was **7.7 GB**. TinyTex was about **_450 MB_**.

TinyTeX is a package by Yihui Xie. It is **much smaller** than Texlive
or MacTex. Info is [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). Basically one
"rolls your own" distribution.

Sometimes one gets an error like 
**! LaTeX Error: File `times.sty` not found.**

That means one needs to install the `times` package. You can verify...

```
tlmgr search --global --file "/times.sty"
```

Or. install the package from the command line

```
tlmgr install times
```

If you still see error messages that you don’t understand, you may
update everything:

```
tlmgr update --self --all
tlmgr path add
fmtutil-sys --all
```
For R users, you can use the corresponding helper functions.
Some examples:

```
library(tinytex)
tlmgr_search('/times.sty')   # search for times.sty
tlmgr_install('psnfss')      # install the psnfss package
tlmgr_update()               # update everything
```

If you see an error message like:

> Remote repository newer than local

It means it is time for you to upgrade (re-install) TinyTeX manually:

```
tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()
```
If you see a message like below, don't panic. Just wait for a couple o
months and prepare for reinstalling TinyTeX.

```
TeX Live 2018 is frozen forever and will no longer be updated. This happens in preparation for a new release.
```


If you’re interested in helping to pretest the new release
(when pretests are available), please read 
[this](https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html).
Otherwise, just wait, and the new release will be ready in due time.

That is all for an average user. Read the
[FAQ](https://yihui.org/tinytex/faq/) page
if you wish to know more technical details about TinyTeX.



## Comments

Try something like this

```
%\begin{comment}
% Section that isn't quite done
%\end{comment}
```


## Deleting backups of packages

```
tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all
```


## Using gnuplot with pdflatex

Try this document

```
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
 
\usepackage{gnuplottex}
\usepackage{verbatim}
    
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}%
\centering%
  
\begin{gnuplot}[terminal=latex, terminaloptions=rotate]
set key box top left
set key width 4
set sample 1000
set xr [-5:5]
set yr [-1:1]
set xlabel '$x$'
set ylabel '$y$'
plot sin(x) w l lc 1 t '$\sin(x)$',\
cos(x) w l lc 2 t '$\cos(x)$',\
tan(x) w l lc 3 t '$\tan(x)$',\
tanh(x) w l lc 4 t '$\tanh(x)$'
\end{gnuplot}

\caption{This is a simple example using the latex-terminal.}%
\label{pic:latex}%
\end{figure}%
\end{document}
```

Run with

```
pdflatex --shell-escape test_gnuplot_tex.tex
```


## Set the LaTeX program at top of the document

1. XeLaTeX

    ```
    % !TeX program = xelatex
    ```

2. pdflatex


    ```
    % !TeX program = pdflatex
    ```
    
## Add the document information to the output PDF

From [Marcus Kuhn](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/publ-tips/#pdfmark):

Include this **before** `\begin{document}`:

```
\usepackage[pdftitle={Playing with Chemfig},
                      pdfauthor={John R. Minter},
                      pdfsubject={chemfig},
                      pdfkeywords={chemfig, LaTeX, pdf}]{hyperref}
```



## Set a custom Unicode font for Hebrew

```

## A dark theme for TexWorks

There is an interesting article on
[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/383271/how-can-i-set-a-dark-theme-in-texworks).

## delete texlive backups

From [stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/172626/backups-for-tlpkg-during-tlmgr-update).    
Set `clean=0` to delete all; `clean=1` will keep a single backup. I use:

```
tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all
```

## tlmgr complains about gpg key

See [www.preining.info](http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/) for details.

On Windows, one can do a one-time install:

```
tlmgr --repository http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/ install tlgpg
```

Note: Avast complains...

## A helpful scientific site:

[csml-wiki.northwestern.edu](https://csml-wiki.northwestern.edu/index.php/Notes_on_using_LaTeX_for_manuscripts)

The general wiki for the CSML group is helpful. The formatting tips on the
link above are quite helpful as are the bibtex notes and the programs to
convert different biblography formates.  There are many journal-specific tips.

A **_locally_** archived copy is [**_here_**](./inc/csml.html).


## Spacing in math mode

From [emerson.emory.edu](http://www.emerson.emory.edu/services/latex/latex_119.html):

In a **math environment**, $\LaTeX$ ignores the spaces you type and puts in
the spacing that it thinks is best. $\LaTeX$ formats mathematics the way
it's done in mathematics texts. If you want different spacing, $\LaTeX$
provides the following four commands for use in math mode:


1. `\;` - a thick space
2. `\:` - a medium space
3. `\,` - a thin space
4. `\!` - a negative thin space

## Encoding

Herb Schulz noted the directive for Unicode at the top of a file

```
% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

## Spell Check for TexWorks

From [tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/235313/how-to-add-spell-checker-to-texworks-on-windows)

1. Download the dictionary corresponding to your desired language from the OpenOffice.org extensions [site](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/search?f%5B0%5D=field_project_tags%3A157).
2. Change the file extension of the downloaded file from .oxt to .zip and extract the files with your archive utility of choice.
3. Open TeXworks and select `Settings and Resources` from the Help menu. A dialog window will open with a link to the TeXworks resources folder.
4. Click the link to open the resources folder. If there is no dictionaries subfolder there yet, then create it now. Open the (possibly newly created) dictionaries subfolder.
5. Copy the `.dic` and `.aff` files from the downloaded .zip file to the dictionaries subfolder.
6. Close and reopen TeXworks. The dictionaries should be listed under the Spelling item in the Edit menu.


## TinyTex and BasicTex on Mac

See [Yihui's write-up](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) and the
[github repository](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex). On Windows,
TinyTeX installs to the user's `%APPDATA%/TinyTeX` folder.

Note Bob Rudis and Noam Ross recommended BasicTex.
It can be installed on a Mac with `homebrew`. Note how one can
install a few packages manually. Keeps the footprint down...

```
brew install gnupg
brew cask install basictex # suggested by @noamross
# plus the following, provided by Kras.Pten
# read why here: http://rud.is/b/2015/10/22/installing-r-on-os-x-100-homebrew-edition/#comment-10603
sudo tlmgr update –-self 
sudo tlmgr update –-all 
sudo tlmgr install titling framed inconsolata
```

### Paths on Windows

I have both TinyTex (TL2018) and a full TL2018 installation on my Win10 VM.
I can switch them by changing the path in my environment string...

The binary paths are:

1. TinyTeX

Win

```
%APPDATA%\TinyTeX\bin\win32
```

Mac

```
The root issue is the environment variable PATH.
If you know how to add a path to PATH, you are all set add:

~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin

to PATH
```

Note this example of installing TinyTeX

```
# borrowed from the Rocker setup at 
# https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/3d62b38a1310/verse/Dockerfile#L50-L52
wget -qO- "https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/raw/master/tools/install-unx.sh" | sh -s - --admin --no-path
sudo mv ~/.TinyTeX /opt/TinyTeX
sudo /opt/TinyTeX/bin/*/tlmgr path add
sudo tlmgr install metafont mfware inconsolata tex ae parskip listings
sudo tlmgr path add
Rscript -e "source('https://install-github.me/yihui/tinytex'); tinytex::r_texmf()"
sudo chown -R root:staff /opt/TinyTeX
sudo chmod -R g+w /opt/TinyTeX
sudo chmod -R g+wx /opt/TinyTeX/bin
```

2. TexLive 2020

```
C:\Apps\texlive\2020\bin\win32
```


### Set the repository

```
tlmgr option repository http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```
### To install TexWorks

```
tlmgr install animate graphicx color ifthen texworks media9 ocgx2
```

### To install Yihui's favorite packages

```

## Beamer Hints

From: Amanda Agan on [twitter](https://twitter.com/amandayagan/status/1099370188884062209)
[2019-02-23]:

> Beamer peeps: we really do **not** need the constant reminder of your name/title/date

> \\setbeamertemplate{footline}[frame number]    
> \\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}    

## XeLaTeX slows down when it encounters a .fd file

This is particularly bad on Windows. The solution came from [stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/57204/different-compilation-times-with-different-operating-systems). The issue is the font cache. the solution is to run the following command from an **Administrator Command Prompt**

```
fc-cache -fv
```

**Note:** [This](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/325278/xelatex-runs-slow-on-windows-machine) thread on StackOverflow notes that it **really helps** to run XeLaTeX as an administrator. It helps to run make from an an **Administrator Command Prompt**.



## HTML Colors
These are frequently used in themes.
[ColorPicker](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp)

## Hyphenation

From [Malaysian LaTeX UG](http://latex-my.blogspot.com/2015/09/rant-warning-i-dont-want-hyphenation-in.html)

>  A quick way to disable hyphenation is to put `\sloppy` just after your `\begin{document}`.

## Spacing

From [TeX Tips](https://twitter.com/TeXtip/status/599224090004697088)

Use `\phantom{}` to insert white space the size of the argument. 
For example, `\phantom{\sum}` is an invisible `\sum`.

## Choose the program to compile

Add the following at the top of the `*.tex` file, choosing the desired program (pdflatex, xelatex):

```
%!TEX program = xelatex
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

The second line will let one use Unicode characters in XeLaTeX.

## XeLaTeX resources

Great, short intros by [Rob Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/xelatex/) and
[LingSUN](http://lingsun.altervista.org/xelatex/), and
[Deep Core](http://blog.deepcore.gr/?p=243)

[Markus Gesmann](http://www.magesblog.com/2011/10/using-sweave-with-xelatex.html) has a great example of using XeLaTeX with Sweave, with the source on [github](https://gist.github.com/mages/1307543) as a gist.

Lots of info in the [fontspec manual](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fontspec/fontspec.pdf)

There is the XeTeX
[SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=xetex)
home page and the 
[sourceforge](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) home page
and the mailing list [archives](http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/)



## Hide the page number on first page of a chapter

```
\thispagestyle{empty}
my text
\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}

```

## Proper links to items in a list

Sime Ungar explained this on the `macos-tex` list on 2018-07-09.

>  I have a rather long itemized list extending several pages, each 
> `\item` labeled differently, and in other parts of my document I want
> to use `\pageref` to link (I am using the hyperref package) the page of
> the corresponding `\item`. The number of the respective page produced
> by `\pageref` is correct, but clicking the link opens the page of the
> first \item which is several pages before the correct page.
> This occurs regardless of whether I use MacTeX 2017 or 2018.
> How should I make the correct link?

Sime later shares the answer:

> Instead of `itemize` use `enumerate`, and if you do not want the
> numbers, instead of just `\item` use `\item[$\bullet$]`.




## Compressing pdflatex output with ghostscript

```
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=compressed.pdf orig.pdf
```

## Crop pdf margina
```
pdfcrop --margins 4 orig.pdf cropped.pdf
```

## Multiple files

There are three ways to put subfile.tex file into main.tex:

```
\include{"filename"}
\input{"filename"}
\import{"path"}{"filename"}
```

* ``\import`` needs ``\usepackage{import}``.
* ``\include`` is only used in the main.tex and cannot be used in subfile.tex
* ``\input`` can be used in main.tex or subfile.tex.

__Note:__ It took me quie a while to discover that I needed to use ``\input`` instead of ``\include`` in a Sweave file to get references to work properly with a table previously written with ``xtable``.

use ``\import`` for absolute paths or ``\subimport`` relative paths
if you want to nest imports, and want the imported file (first level)
to use its own path as the base for further imports (second level). 
see [stackexchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58485/14697)

## Getting figure numbers correct
Some old but excellent advice from
[Luke Maciak](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/04/14/latex-fixing-wrong-figure-numbers/)

What I tell you right now may save you hours of extensive
debugging, cursing under your breath, commenting out custom
code dealing with figure layout and much frustration.

Whenever you use figures, always (and I mean ALWAYS EVER
FOREVER ALWAYS) put ``\caption`` first, and ``\label``
second like this:

```
\begin{figure}[htp]
   \centering
 		\includegraphics{image.eps}
 	\caption{Some Image} 	% \caption IS ALWAYS FIRST
 	\label{fig:some-image} 	% \label IS ALWAYS SECOND
\end{figure}
```
Easy way to remember this -- order your image tags alphabetically.
C goes before L. Always. No exception.

If you put the ``\label`` above ``\caption`` you will run into
trouble when referencing figures inside subsections. In my case,
the caption underneath the figure would say Fig. 4.2 but the
output of ``\ref`` would be 4.3.10 because somehow it was picking
up the section numbers wrong. The whole damn chapter 4 had the
caption/label pairs flipped – but the rest of the document was
fine. I have no clue what possessed me to write it this way.

Now I know better. This is the 3 hours of my life that I will
never get back. All because I put label before a caption.
Do not do that to yourself!

## Dick Koch explains multiple TeX distributions on Mac

From the TexLive mailing list (after minor editing for Rmarkdown)...

> Gosh, we work for years on this stuff, and then it turns out that users are
> oblivious to it.  (No criticism, just a little astonishment!)
>
> 1. BasicTeX does not install GUI apps. It just installs a TeX Distribution. Your current GUI apps work fine with it.
>
> 2. BasicTeX is installed in `/usr/local/texlive/2019basic`. BasicTeX-2019-Hardened is installed in `/usr/local/texlive/2019basic-hardened`. The full TeX Live 2019 is in `/usr/local/texlive/2019`.
>
> 3. All TeX Distributions from us share `~/Library/texmf`
>
> 4. Sometimes TeX Distributions need to write information (like font data) when being run by a user in user mode. They do this using special folders in `~/Library/texlive`. Each distribution has two folders here for different kinds of data. The full TeX Live 2019's folders in the location are `2019/texmf-var` and `2019/texmf-config`. For BasicTeX this year, they are `2019basic/texmf-var` and `2019basic/texmf-config`. The hardened versions are `2019basic-hardened/texmf-var` and `2019basic-hardened/texmf-config`. All very systematic.
>
> 5. Long ago, Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens invented a "TeXDist data structure". Every one of our TeX Live based distributions has data there. Also, `/Library/TeX/texbin`, `/Library/TeX/Documentation`, `/Library/TeX/Root` point into this data structure. In particular, TeXLive-2018, TeXLive-2019, BasicTeX-2018, BasicTeX-2019, and BasicTeX-2019-Hardened each have sections of data there.
>
> 6. Remember long ago when Jerome Laurens had a Preference Pane which switched the active data? This pane actually switched a symbolic link in the TeX Dist data (NOT `/Library/TeX/texbin`, but some more hidden link). Switching this link automatically switched **EVERYTHING**, so your GUI apps, the command line, and everything suddenly used a different TeX Distribution.
>
> 7. More recently, TeX Live Utility is used to switch the default TeX distribution. It does exactly the same thing that the old Preference Pane did. The pane is now obsolete because Apple kept switching the standards which Pref Panes need to use: universal-binary, then 32-bit Intel, then 64-bit intel with Garbage Collection, then 64-bit Intel without Garbage Collection but using Automatic Reference Counting. That's because Pref Panes are plug ins for Apple's Preference Pane application, so any change in that application changed how Pref Panes work. So we switched to TeX Live Utility.
>
>8. So the answer to your full set of questions is that you can switch between `TeXLive-2019` and `BasicTeX-2019-Hardened` exactly like you currently switch between `TeXLive-2018` and `TeXLive-2019`.



# Citations

## Hiding citations
A useful hint from
[texblog.org](http://texblog.org/2014/08/05/undefining-a-command-in-latex/)

> I was editing a poster and didn't know whether or not to include a bibliography. I had already added ``\cite`` commands and wanted to get an idea of what it looks like without bibliography. So I commented out ``\printbiliography`` to get rid of the bibliography, but the numbers were still in the text. Removing all ``\cite`` commands wasn't an option in case I wanted to have them back. The solution was to overwrite ``\cite`` with a command that's defined, but does nothing:

```
\let\cite\empty
```
This did the trick!


## Citations in figures

Another old but useful tip from
[Luke Maciak](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2006/07/26/latex-citations-in-figures/)

For some unknown, mysterious reason you can’t put a ``\cite``
command as an argument of the ``\caption`` statement. I stumbled
upon this today when I was trying to attribute an image that I
shamelessly 'snurched' from the web.

Apparently, the cause is not as mysterious as I thought. If you
want to know why this happens, do some research on
``fragile commands and moving arguments``. Do you need to
understand these things throughly? Probably not. You just
need to remember that you may sometimes need to protect a
``\cite`` when it is an attribute of something else:

```
\caption{Very Stupid Image \protect\cite{source}}
```

So here is a new rule of thumb: if you nest a command in
an attribute of another command and latex freaks out, you
might be dealing with a fragile command inside of a moving
attribute. Sticking a ``\protect`` in front of the command
is a good place to start troubleshooting the problem.

### Update 12/15/2006 04:03:46 PM

One caveat here -– if you put citations in image captions, then
they will show up in your list of figures. This looks a little
ugly, and it can mess up your citation order. For example,
if you use IEEEtran.bst for your BibTex formating, then the
first cited source should be ``[1]``, second source should be
``[2]`` and etc... Unfortunately if your list of figures is on
page 3, then the first citation on that page will be counted
as ``[1]`` even if the actual image does not show up till
page 64.

So be careful with these.

### Update 01/08/2007 10:05:32 AM

I figured out the caption and the list of figures issue. It
turns out that ``\caption`` can take an optional parameter
which is the text for the list like so:

```
\caption[Stupid Image]{Stupid Image \protect\cite{source}}
```

If you use it this way the citation only shows up under the
figure, but not in the LoF and thus the order of references
is preserved.


# Avoiding Sweave...

Sometimes it is helpful to write a table from R to be included.
Even if one uses Sweave for some tasks, this trick can make
the file shorter...


```{r}
library(xtable)
df <- data.frame(one=c(1,2,3),
                 two=c(1,2,3),
                 three=c(1,2,3),
                 four=c(1,2,3))

tab.tex  <- './tab.tex'
o.names <- colnames(df)
# if one wants clean column names...
n.names <- c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro")
colnames(df) <- n.names
# note ncol+1 entries
dig <- c(0,1,1,1,1)
xt <- xtable(df, digits = dig,
             caption = "My table.",
             label = "tab:myTab",
             table.placement = "tbp",
             caption.placement = "top",
             size = "small",
             table.placement="ht")

sink(tab.tex)
# change rownames to TRUE if meaningful
print(xt, include.rownames=FALSE)
sink()

# the lets one include the file...
str.ei <- '\\endinput'
cat(str.ei, file=tab.tex, sep='\n', append=TRUE)


```

# System Administration

## Spaces in file names

Some packages have problems with paths with spaces on Windoze

Typical culprits are ("Program Files", "Documents and Settings")
so I like a non-standard install. I do this for R as well...
I also switch using environment variables.

```
C:/Apps/texlive/
C:/Apps/texlive/2015
C:/Apps/texlive/texmf-local

C:/Apps/R/R-3.1.3
C:/Apps/R/R-3.2.0
C:/Apps/R/Rtools

```



## Regenerating config files

```
tlmgr generate language
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def
tlmgr generate fmtutil
fmtutil-sys --all
tlmgr generate updmap
updmap-sys
```

## finding locations
**Q:** does anyone know how to ask an existing TL installation
where it has placed the equivalents of texmf-var and
texmf-config?? i.e. if the users has used the advanced
installer to place things in alternative locations?

**A:** from Norbert Preining (preining@logic.at).

```
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG
```

The -var-value was introduced to make lookups easier
on Windows, which has horrible quoting rules.

```
tlmgr option location http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```

```
tlmgr option location  http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/
```

## TexWorks autocompletion
[TexDev](http://www.texdev.net/2013/09/01/customising-texworks-auto-completion/)

[TexWorks wiki](https://code.google.com/p/texworks/wiki/CodeCompletion)

TeXworks uses a simple list of simple completion options.
The basic format for the auto-complete files is to have a
first line for the encoding

```
%% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
```

then one or more lines for each completion. Each line can
either just have a completion value

```
\alpha
```

or have a ***shortcut*** text version

```
xa:=\alpha
```

There are then a few bits of 'helper' syntax. You can use
``#INS#`` to show where the cursor should end up, ``#RET``
for a return and Unicode character U+2022 (BULLET)
as a marker you can jump to using 
``Ctrl-Tab`` (``Option-Tab`` on the Mac). So for example
the ``\documentclass`` lines read

```
\documentclass{#INS#}#RET#
\documentclass[#INS#]{•}#RET#
```


## a libpng issue

During the pretest of TL2013, an issue was noted by
Werner Lemberg (wl.gnu.org) regarding a bug in some
recent versions of libpng.

> ...  a serious bug introduced in 1.6.0 (and
> fixed in 1.6.2) causing the creation of invalid files.

Werner recommends updaing to 1.6.2, but this is causing the
issues for the TL 2013 developers. Werner did suggest this
workaround...

> BTW, the libpng issue can be fixed by running the
> `png-fix-too-far-back' binary (which comes with recent
> libpng versions) on affected PNG images, and I was able
> to successfully continue my lilypond build after doing this.
