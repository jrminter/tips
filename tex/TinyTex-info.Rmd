**Update**: had issues with TinyTeX. Decided to use MacTeX 2021 on Apple and
TexLive on Windows. Did this on 2021-04-08. A **long** day.

N.B. On 2021-04-17 I removed MacTeX 2021 on Mac and replaced with TinyTeX.
Updates worked again without sudo!

Also note: `tlmgr info` lists installed packages.


Note that the texlive.iso released on 2021-03-25 was 4446390272 bytes.
This is a big download with many packages that I never use, This is why
TinyTex is so important. 

Note that TinyTeX-1-v2021.04.tgz was 86.9 MB, significantly smaller.

Note that TinyTex is [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).
The github issues [here](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/293).

I used this repository

```
https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/texlive/tlnet
```

```
tinytex::install_tinytex(version = 'latest')
```

Today I went back to TinyTeX on all my systems. Everything installs,
but some packages are broken and not supported.

# Known problems

1. TikZ is broken

See [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/search?q=texlive+tikz+example).

There are many complaints.
