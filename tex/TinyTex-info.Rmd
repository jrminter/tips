**Update**: had issues with TinyTeX. Decided to use MacTeX 2021 on Apple and
TexLive on Windows. Did this on 2021-04-08. A **long** day.


Note that the texlive.iso released on 2021-03-25 was 4446390272 bytes.
This is a big download with many packages that I never use, This is why
TinyTex is so important. 

Note that TinyTeX-1-v2021.04.tgz was 86.9 MB, significantly smaller.

Note that TinyTex is [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).
The github issues [here](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/293).

I used this repository

```
https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/texlive/tlnet
```

```
tinytex::install_tinytex(version = 'latest')
```
