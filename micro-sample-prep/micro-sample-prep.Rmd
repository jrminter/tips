# SEM/FIB

From Jim Quinn to Stephane Nizet on 2022-02-10


Stephane -

If Si/silicon or Al/aluminum does not work for you as substrates,
then I next suggest Ni alloy 200 straight from the McMaster catalog
or equivalent vendor in your neck of the woods.

I have used it before.  It usually comes with a reasonable surface
brush finish, polishes nicely to mirror surface, does not tarnish,
and less than 0.4% impurities.  The rigidity and hardness are a plus.

To me, nickel is the next metal in line after rejecting aluminum
or silicon for flat, conductive, pure, and smooth substrates.

kind regards,
- Jim
