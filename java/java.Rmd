# Java on MacOS

Notes from Homebrew: 2021-03-09

> openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into
> `/usr/local`, because macOS provides similar software and installing
> this software in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
> 
> If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH, run:
>
> ```
> echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
> ```
>
> For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
> 
> ```
>  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk/include"
> ```
