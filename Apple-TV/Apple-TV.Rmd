# Rewind or Fast Forward on Apple TV

- Continuously rewind or Fast-Forward

> **Press and hold** the **left**  or **right** on the **click-pad ring**
> **(second generation Siri Remote).**
> **Press `left` or `right` repeatedly to cycle through rewind or**
> **fast-forward speed options (2x, 3x, 4x).** 


While the new Siri Remote that’s included with the 2021 Apple TV 4K has been
redesigned, it retains some of the better elements offered by the old remote.
The glass trackpad is still there but has been replaced by a round trackpad
surrounded by aluminum. This new remote also features raised edges around th
circumference of the circle, providing some tactility to the trackpad.

So when it comes to actually control your movies and TV shows, Apple has
included a couple of different options. The first method to know about if you
want to fast forward on Apple TV is to just skip forwards or backward. This can
be done by simply clicking back or forward on the aforementioned trackpad. When
clicking left or right on the trackpad, you’ll be able to skip around in
10-second increments.

Obviously, skipping in small increments is fine most of the time, but if you
want to actually scrub through a show or movie in order to get to a certain spot,
things are a bit different. In order to fast forward on Apple TV continuously,
you’ll need to press and hold the right button on the trackpad. When you click
the button, the default speed is 2x, but this can be increased to either 3x or
4x speeds by continuing to press the button. Once you’ve reached the spot in the
movie or show that you want, just click the center of the trackpad or the
Play/Pause button in order to resume the content.
